‘The Stoice in general ere far more opposed to the established
religion than we Epicureans ; if they grant the existence of a deity,
which they do not all do, they at any rete acknowledge no more than
one God, while they impose on the multitude with their names and
allegorica They are worse atheists, with their ethera and elements,
’ than Diagoras, who confessed the existence and power of the (luds.
By asserting that God cannot be the author of evil they do away
with religious sanctiens, which we retain3 they call the Gods mortal,

Ι we assert their eternity. Evenii they allowed punishment in word,

who could fear these senseless elementsl Nona would regard Gods
incapable of motion or of sense; or pay any heed 10 the moral teach·
ing of those who are in doubt whether there are Gods or what is

from my nn. on 55 42, 43 that most of tha points touched by 0. ara ,
fully treated by Ph, but there is no allusion to the Magians in the
extant fragments of the latter. In the 3rd section, as far as we cen
judge from broken phrases (see n. on 5 49 docet eum eoae cim), Ph.
seems to have treated of the divine nature in a manner not unlike (lz
he speaks of the Gods as free from anger and favour and absolutely
perfect and blessed, and he is equally strong against superstitious
fears; but he makes religion a much more practical thing (see the
passages quoted on 5 44 quod tectum essct). Thus ‘piety is productiva
of innocence and harmlessness (p. 95), by innocence man may imitate
the blessedness of the Gods (p. 148) 3 Epicurus honoured his parents,
loved his brothers, observed all religious duties (p. 118), and charged
