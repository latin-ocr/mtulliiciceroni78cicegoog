In regard to religion, Socrates, while often employing language

suited to the popular polytheism, held that there was one supreme
God who was to the universe what the soul of man was to his body,
that all things were arranged and ordered by Him for good, and
that man was the objectos His special providence and might look
for guidanee from Him in eracles and otherwise. The soul was
immortal, and had in it a divine element Socrates believed that
he was himself favoured beyond others in the warning sign (τὸ
δαιμόνιον) which checked him whenever he was about to take an
ill-judged step.

The personal enmity provoked by the use of the Socratis aleretur,
and themora general dislike to the Socratis method as unsettling the
grounds of belief and undermining authority, adislilre which showed
itself in the Olouds of Aristophanes as early as 423 aa, combined
with the democratia reaction, after the overthrow of the Thirty, to
bring about the execution of Socrates in the year 399 ac. The
charges on which he was condemned were that he did not believe
in the Gods of the established religion, that he introduced new Gods,
and that he corrupted the young: the last charge probably referring
to the fact that Socrates freely pointed out the faults of the Athenian
constitution, and that many of his disciples took the anti-popular
side (N. D. 11 18, 167).

Our authorities for the life of Socrates are the writings of his
two disciples, Xenophon and Plato. The former (440-355 sc.)
was a soldier and country gentlemau with a taste for literature, who
endeavoured to clear his master’s memory from the imputationes
impiety and immorality hy publishing the Memorabilia, a collection
of bis noteworthy sayings and discourses. Xenophon was banished
from Athens for fighting in the Spartan ranke at Coronea. Plato
is distinguished from the other disciples of Socrates as the one who
represents most truly the many-sidedness of his master, completing
indeed and developing what was defective in him and incorporating
all that was valuable in the earlier philosophare Before treating
of him it will be convenient to speak shortly of the ‘imperfect' or
one-sided Socraticists.
