powers, these formed a whole unique in the history of the world 3
and wc can well believe that they acted like arr electric shock on
the more susceptible minds 61 116 time. For we must remember
that Socrates did not, like earlier philosophers, content himself with
imparting the results 61 solitary meditation to a few favoured dis-
ciples: nor did he, like the Sophiste, lecture to a paying audience on
a set subject; but obeying‚ as he believed, a divine call, he mixed
with men of every class wherever they were 16 16 found, cross-
questioning them as to the grounds of their belisia, and endeavouriug
to awaken in them a consciousness 61 11611 ignorance and a desire
161 real knowledge. His own account of his call is as follows:
one 61 116 disciples was told hythe Oracle at Delphi that Socrates
was the wisest 61 men. Socrates could not conceive how this should
be, as he was conscious only 61 ignorance3 hut he determined to
question some of those who had the highest repnte 161 wisdom;
accordingly he went to statesmen and poeta and oratore, and last
of all to craftsmen, but everywhere met with the same response: ,
none really knew what were the true ends 61 life, but each one
fancied that he knew, and most were angry when Socrates attempted
to disturb their illusion 61 knowledge. Thus 16 arrived at the
conclusion that what the oracle meant was that the first step 16
knowledge was the consciousness 61 ignorance, and he believed, in
consequence 61 61161 divine warnings, that it was his special mission
to bring men to this consciousness.

The next step on the way 16 knowledge was to get clear general
notions, by comparing a number 61 specific cases in which the same
general term was employed; or, according to the phraseology 61
ancient philosophy, 16 666 116 One (the kind or genus, the general
principle, the law, the idea) in the Many (the subordinate species 61
individuals, 116 particulars, the phenomena, the facts) and conversely
to risc from the Many to the One. The process 61 doing this he
called Dialectic, aa discourse‚ since it was by question and answer
that he believed the proposed definition could be best tested, and
the universal idea which was latent in each individual could be
brought 16 light. Truth and right were the same 161 all: it was
only ignorance, mistake, confusion which made them seem different
to different men. And similarly it is ignorance which leads men
to commit vicious actions: no one willingly does wrong, since to
do right is the only way to happiness, and every man desines
happiness Thus virtue is a knowledge 61 116 way to happiness,
