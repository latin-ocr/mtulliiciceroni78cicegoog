virtue of a continuous stream of images combining to produce in us the
impression of a human form Such a description suits fairly with the
account given of Democritus' theology (N. D. 1 120) according to which the
Gods are nothing more than combinatione of ethereal atoms floating about
as incaptum but it is difficult to see how it could be reconciled with
the ordinary account of Epicurus’ innumerable Gods of the intermutatis,
far removed from the sphere of those atomio storms which are ever making
and unmaking the surrounding worlds Ifthea‘mcpiaes which appeartomen
are composed of atoms thrown off from the Gods of the marmoratio, why
may not atoms find their way back again from our world to them, as in

. fact is asserted by Cotta§ 1142 How can beings which have no soliditas

be continually throwing off those myriads of atoms of which the images
are formed, especially when we consider the vast distance of the iater-
maadic from the earth, and reflect that, radiation being equal in all
directions, there must be the same crowding of divine images at every
point of this immense circumfereneel Again, il the Gods have no separate
individuality, how are they capable of conversing together and exhibiting
an ideal of the philosophie life, as Philodemus assertedl And how are
such Gods in any degree truer to the popular conception than the ἀέρας καὶ
πνεύματα which Philodemus charges the Stoice with worshipping (p. 84
folt)t SecMunroonLucr.v152. Assuming then, aswe apparently may,
that either Epicurus himself or some of his followers acknowledgedadivinity
ola more spiritual type, distinct from those of the intermundiis, there is
much in the description which is curicusly suggestive of atheology with
which we are familiar in the present day. When people understand by the
name God ‘a stream of tendency which makes for righteousness'‚ or in
other words, a predominating character in the events of life and the
phenomena of the universe which answers to and calls out in us an ideal
of goodness (and why not also which answers to and calls out our ideals of
beauty and oi wisdom l) they do not at first ascribe to uod personality or .
numerical identity, but es they meditate on the impressions which they

⁴ receive, they become gradually conscious of a unity, shaping itself,“for some

at least, ἀνθρωποειδῶς, into a human form, in which they recognize the
features of the j'udge, the ruler, the father. Some such idealistic interpre-
tation of the physical formularies of his school was certainly not more
difficult to a religious Epicurean than the spiritualization of the myths was

· to a Stoic, and however far removed from ordinary Epicurean belief, itis

not altogether inconsistent with some of the citatione from Philodemus
given under qaod beatum ξ 45.
