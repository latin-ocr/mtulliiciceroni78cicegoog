in all other cases. Epicurus himself does not seem to have carried
his logical investigatione further than this.

The only reason for studying physica was to free the soul from
superstitious fears, and with this view to prove that the constitution
of the universe might be explained from mechanical carrses. The
two main principles asserted by Epicurus were that nothing could
be produced out of nothing, and that what existe cannot become
ncnexistent. From these principles he dedueed the truth oi the
atomio system, differing however from Democritus in one importent
point, via in his explanation of the manner in which the atoma
were brought together. Democritus had asserted that the heavier
atoma overtook the lighter in their downward course, and thus
initiated the collision which finally resulted in a general vortical
movement. Epicurus retaining the same crude view of‘up’and ‘down’
held that each atem moved with equal speed and that they could
only meet by the'inherent sels-movement of the atoms, which enabled
them to swerve from the rigid vertieal line, and he found a confir-
mation of this indeterminate movement of the atoma in the free will
of man. In other respects there is little difference between the
physical views of Democritus and Epicurus. Both held that there
were innumerable worlds continually coming into being and passing
out of being in the inlinitude of space. As to subordinate arrange·
ments Epicurus thought it unnecessary and indeed impossible to
assign any one theory as certain It was enough if we could imagine
theorias which were not palpably inadmissible, and which enabled us
, to dispensa with any supernatural cause. Nor was it at all necessary
to suppose that the same phenomenon‚ e. g. sunrise, always proceeded
from the same cause. The existence of the present race of animals
was explained, aa it had been by Empedocles, on a rude Darwinian
hypothesis. Out os the innumerable combinatione of atoms which
had been tried throughout the infinite ages of the past, those only
survived which were found to be suited to their environment. The
eye was not made to see with, but being made by the fortuitous

concourse of atoms it was found on trial to have the property of
aeeing. But though denying in the etr-ongest terma any creatire
or governing Bessan, Epicurus did not object to Gods who did not
intes-fere with the world or with man. On the contrary he held ·
that the universality ol the belief in Gods proved that such belief
was based upon a primary notion, n real πρόληψις, though it had
· boen corrupted by the admixtum oi idle imaginatione, ὕπολήψεις.
