parc also the very similar language used ol perception and images geucss Ι

rally‚ Diog. Ia x 48 ῥεῦσις ἀπὸ τῶν σωμάτων τοῦ ἐπιπολῆς συνεχὴς συμβαίνει
οὔκ ἐπίδηλος aiodian tut τὴν ἀνταναπλήρωσιν, Lucr. Iv 26 foll. esp. 87 ‘out
lines of shapes flit about so exquisitcly fine as each by itself to be invisible ',
104, 256 ‘the things themselves are seen, though the images which striks
the eye are invisible ³, 190 ‘the images succoed one another like the rays of
light ³, suppeditatur mim confestim lamina lamen, 774 (accounting for the
movements‘of shapes seen in dreams) ‘so great is the velocity‚ so great the
supply of things ', tantaqne seruitiii quood ert tempore in ιιιιο Ι copia parti·
catarum at possit sappeditare; and see the passages quoted from Philodemus
under docet eam esse nim From these it would appear that the phrase
must mean ‘when the images have become perceptible through their mutual '
similarity and their uninterrupted succession’. Any one image would be
too fine to attract the attention, but the repetition of similar images ever
streaming onwards, produces on the mind the impression of one unchanging
object. A familiar illustration would be the rainbOW, or the wheel of fire
produced by rapidly whirling round a burning stick. I agree with Hirzel
in rejecting Sch's explanation of similitudo as referring to the likeness
. between the images and the mind on which they impinge; on the other
hand transitio, lit. ‘the passing before the eyes’ (as in Ovid Ptcm. Am. 615
multaque corporibus transitione nocent) appears tometobeatranslationof the
Gr, φορά, not (as Hirzel takes it) of ὰνταναπλήρωσις which is rather sappa-
ditatio. There is a slight inaccuracy here in the use of trana, it is applied
as though by an ab entra spectator to a stream of images, not passing
before, but coming full into the eyes or the mind

. cum infinita-affluat. Hirzel andO. F. Miiller have adopted Brieger's
emendation ceria, which certainly reads more easily with infinita. On the

< other hand species is the technical term to denote the mental impression

produced bythe imagines (cf. ξ 107 fac imagines esce...species dumtaxat
oly‘ieitar; Dia 11 137 nnita species cogitari potest nisipalsa imaginum,- Fut.
43 ninam objectam imprimit et qnasi signat in animo snam mecam) so that
I should have been inclined to keep the old reading, translating ‘there
rises up a never-ending impression of eraotly similar images produced
from countless atoms’, were it not for the following afflant, which is very
suitably used of the mites imaginum flowing in upon the mind (cf.1Div.
i. a), but less suitably of the species which springs up within the mind
itseli as a result of the inflowing imagines. Still we have fluentiam
namnam ξ 109 where see n.

οι individuis: so ξ 110 effigies en indiuiduis corporibus oritaa· The
images were composed either of the surface atoms of the στερέμνιον (Lucr.
ιν 67 praesertim cam ciat in sommis corpora rebar 1 muita minata jaci
qaae possint ordine eodem 1 qao fiaerint ctformni semareyiyaram) or of loose
atoms floating about in the air (Lucr. 1v rasfolt). Zeller (Eng. tr. p. 443)
strangely translates ‘picturas emanating from innumerabis divine indi-
viduals' (ptttlicdcn Iirdinidam in the original).
