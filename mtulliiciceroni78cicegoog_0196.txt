identifying it with the books referred 10 by Arist. Aa. 1 1 in the phrase ἐν

τοῖςπερὶ φιλοσοφίας λεγομένοις. Bernays gives a full account of it in his .

Die Diolopo d. Arestotclos pp. 95-114. From this it appears that the
101 book was concerned with the praephilosophic speculatione 01 the East
and of Graece: the discussion respecting Orpheus N. D. 1 107 10 supposed
to have belonged 10 this. The find book dealt with the earlier philo·
sophera, including Plato; the quotation in Tosa11168 is probably taken
from it. The 3rd book, in which 1111010110 gave his own view,is largely
quoted from in the speech of Balbus, N. D. 11 42, 44, 95 and without
reference in ἐξ 37, 51, 01 Bywater in Journal of Philolopp vol vn pp. 64-
87, and the fragments as they are given by Heitz in the Paris, or Rose in
the Berlin, edition of Aristotle.

non dissentiens. Colotes is attached by Plutarch II. 1115 foridenti-
fying the doctrines of Plato and the Peripatetics. It was the view of
Antiochus and the eclectics, and is often propounded by O. as his own, 01

menti tribuit divinitatem. In Met. xn 6, 7 1011. God is defined as ζῷον
citior ἄριστον, pure incorporeal reason, νόησις νοήσεως, ever engaged in con-
templation 01 himself, who himself unmoved has from all eternity moved
all other things by a divine attraction (κινεῖ ὥς ἐρόμενον, cf Gerr. et Corr. 11
10 έν ἅπασιν dd τοῦ βελτίονος ὀρέγεται ἡ φύσις). Noble as this view is, it
yet presente some points of contact with the Epicurean theology, which
might have been taken advantage of, if the critic had had any other object
beyond that of depreciating all who preceded his master.

mundum ipsum deum. Compare ΕιΙι. 110111 14 πάνταγὰρ φύσει ἔχει
τι θεῖον ; Cael. 11 l, where ὁ πᾶς οὐρανὸς 10 said 1ο be ἀθάνατον καὶ θεῖον, and
just below ‘we shall speak most suitably about it if we regard it as God';
again c. 3, θεοῦ ἐνέργεια ἀθανασία· ὥστ’ ἀνάγκη τῷ θείῳ κίνησιν ἀίδιον ὑπάρχειν·
ἐπεὶ δ’ ὁ οὐρανὸς τοιοῦτος (σῶμα γὰρ τι θεῖον) tut τοῦτο...κόκλιρ del κινεῖται;
also Met. xn 8 ‘it has been handed down in mythical form from ancient
times that the first mover, and the world which it sets in motion, are Gods,
and that all nature is encircled with divinity: but this high doctrine was

mixed up with anthropomorphic conceptione. Eliminating these‚weshall ⁸ .

hold that it was a divine inspiration which led our ancestors to the 0011-
clusion θεοὺς τὰς πρῶτος οὐσίας ἄνοι’. These expressions howeverare not 10
be understood in a Stoic sense as though Aristotle identified the world aud
God. Transcendonce is a distinct feature of tho Platonic and Aristotelian
theology as opposed to the Stoic Immanence.

alium quendam: Sch. understands this of the quinto 001000, the aether
of which the heaven itself and the heavenly bodies are composed, but this
is the ardor of the next clariss: besides, Aristotle never represents it ae
presiding over the universe 01 setting it in motion Krische is, I believe,
right in taking it of the one supreme sod, who hos been already referred
10 as meru, but now appears in another character as the Firstmover, 01
