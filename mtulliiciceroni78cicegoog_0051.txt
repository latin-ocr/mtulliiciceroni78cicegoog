the Stoics in a later page, and that Oicero wrote in too great a hurry
either to foreseo this, or to correct what he had already written.
Perhaps this is going too sar. It is plain that Cicero felt the neces-
sity for compressing very much the historical review, and a simple
means 01 doing this was to omit repetitione. He was also about to
speak 01 Prodicus in Cotta’s reply (N. D. 1 118), and he alludes to
Heraclitus as the forerunner 01 110 Stoics in 111 35, stating that, as
hc chose to be unintelligible, it was useless to discuss his opinions.

So far there appears to be no improbability 10 Cicero's having
borrovved directly from Philodemus, but it becomes more difficult 10
suppose this, when we compare the two writings more minutely.
Thus, while both criticize Anaximenes, Ph. has nothing in common
with O, but merely speaks 01 airas without sensation3 while there
is a sair agreement as to the doctrines 01 Anaxagoras, there is no
criticism in Ph.; on Pythagoras and Democritus Ph. is too frag-
mentary to allow 01 comparison 3 on Parmenides there is hardly any
agreement, on Diogenes they agree to a certain extent, but Ph. is
much fuller ; on Xenophon Ph. quotes correctly, as far as the frag-
ment is legible‚ but gives no criticism, while O. is wrong throughout 3
on Antisthenes they agree, but Ph. has no criticism; on Aristotle
there is nothing legible in Ph. beyond the actual reference ; on Theo·
phrastus Ph. has merely a reference to a treatise not mentioned by
O.; on Persaeus there is substantial agreement, but Ph. is much
fuller, he does not however give anything 01 the criticism we find in
(1.3 'between Theophrastus and Persaeus O. has some 32 lines on
= Strato, Zeno, and Cleanthes, to which there was probably something
corresponding in pp. 73-75 of Ph, where we can trace broken
allusions to the universal reason and the power that holds all things
together, but the names are lost; while there is general agreement
on Chrysippus (see my n. on N. D. 139),Ph. is much fuller, except
where O. dilates on the Stoio idea 01 the Divino Law, so on Diogenes
of Babylon.

This slight sketch will show that, if 0. has horrowed from Ph. he
has used him with the utmost freedom, omitting without scruple,
and, if we may weigh the evidence 01 the fragments according to the
ordinary law 01 chanceS, one would say, adding not unfrequently
from other sources It is true that the absence 01 criticism after

each name in Philodemus, may bo explained by the fact that he = π

reserves it all for the end (pp. 84-89). But then when we examine
this later criticism, we find nothing in common between it and that
