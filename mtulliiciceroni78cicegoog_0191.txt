diogenes (Krische 163-177) distinctly attributed reason to the air,
making it the principle of life and understanding in man, and the sovereign
ol the universe, in his own words quoted by Simplicius (R.- and P. §63
foll.) ἄνθρωποςκαὶ τὰ ἄλλα ζῷα ἆναπνέοντα (qtae τῷ α’ἔρι· καὶ τοῦτο αὐτοῖσι

We also leam from Theophrastus that he attributed sensatior 10 air

the following· terme, Δ. ε’παινεῖ τὸν ’Όμηρον nir 011 μυθικῶς ἀλλ’ ἀληθῶς ὑπὲρ

comio poet Philemon (Meineke p. 391) ὃν οὐδὲ εἷς tetradeo 011δὲ ἓν ποιῶν Ι

Plato: Krische 181-204. The fact that we have, in this 21111 criti-
cism of Plato, no reference to the former contained in §§ 18-24 is one
of the arguments alleged to show that this whole section was inserted as
an afterthought. The charge against Plato is (1) inconsistency: at one
time he denies the possibility of naming God and iorbids us 10 inquire
into his nature, at another he tells us that the heaven, the stars, the
souls &c are Gods; (2) these assentiens are not only inconsistent but
false in themselves; (3) particularly the assertion that God is incorporeal.
With the exception of Sch. all the edd seem content to understand incori-
ataatia of the first two assertions that God cannot be named and that he
ought not to be made the subject of investigation; but as these are
evidently quite consistent, Sch. holds that the opposition lies between them
011 the one hand and the asserticn of the incorporea] nature of God (qaod
νοω-ἀσώματον) on the other. He allows that the grammatioal connexion
’ oi the two sentences is very different from what we should have expected
if they were intended to have this relation 10 one another, but offers no
explanation or suggestion. It seems to me plain that, as the latter
stands, it is impossible to suppose them thus related; and no less plain
that the sentence beginning with idem (a word constantly employed 1ο
mark the coexistence of two apparently inconsistent facts) refers back
10 the qni ia Piraeeo of the first sentence. The opposition between
