agree with Klotz (dola. 1115)es against Madv. ap. Orelli (who is followed
by Sch Baiter and Mulier) and should translate the passage as follows: ‘In
the same way then as, when I imagine myself to see Gracchus in hie speech
preseniing the voting um about (10 decide the case 01) Octavius, I at the
time essert this 10 be a mere groundless fancy, while you on the contrary
essert that the images of the two men continue to exist, and after arriving
in the Capitol are then carried on to me,-so (you asseri it to be) in the
case of God, whose recurring likeness strikes upon the mind and leads it
10 recognize the divine bleesedness and eternity’. The simple framework

giving both the Academia and Epicurean views in the compared case
of Gracchus, omits the former, as obvious, in the case of the gods, and
so confusas the construction. Madv. omits ipitnr, which connects the
special application with the general principle, takes ut=oelnt, as in ξ 88
01 dempti, and changes pervenerint into pervenerim, making 100 fieri a
sort oi corollary depending on 011011 understood, instead oi the apodosis of
the sentence. Sch. (N. Jahrb. 1875, p. 691) points out that there is no
occasion ior perverterim, the scene might be imagined without going to the
Capitol, though itis true a visit there might suggest it ; on the other hand
the vagrani images of G. and Ο. may be supposed 10 attach to themselves
images of the Capitol by their visit there, 01. Dio. 11 137 ieta ipitm me

isas follows. In 133 ao. the passing of the Agrarian law of Ti. Gracchus '
was stopped by the veto of Octavius his colleague in the tribunate: after a
vein attempt 10 induce him to desist from his opposition, G. proposed his
deposition by the tribes. When 17 001 01 the 35 tribes had voted for the
motion, G. once more urged 0. 1ο yield‚ but he answering ‘complete what
thou hest hegun'‚ the voting was continued and Ο. deposed
