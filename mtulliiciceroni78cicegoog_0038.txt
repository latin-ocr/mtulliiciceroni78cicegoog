GREEK PHILOSOPHY. xxxv

And he pleased himself with the thought that he might find in the
Gods a pattern 01 the true philosophie life. Perlect happiness, im·
mortality and human shape were 01 110 0000000 01 1110 πρόληψις.
Hence he inferred that they must be eomposed 01 110 finest atoms
and enjoy eternal repoee in the vacant spaces between the worlds,
undisturbed by those labours 01 sustaining and superintending the
universe which were ascribed to them by other schools‚ 00 well 00
hythe popular religion (N. D. 143-56). Such Gods were worthy
01 110 worship and the imitation 01 110 philosophare. 00 110 nature
01 110 seul and the manner in which it receives its impressione by
images 11010 without, Epicurus follows Democritus.

While the ethical doctrines of Epicurus are mainly the sameas
those 01 Aristippus, he differs from him in attaching more value to
permanent tranquillity than 10 momentary gratification, and 0100111
preferring mental pleasures 10 bodily‚ as stronger and more enduring.
Virtue is desirable as 110 means to attain pleasure. The wisc man,
10. 110 virtuous man, is happy because 10 101100 from 110 10010 01
110 Gods and 01 death, because 10 has learnt 10 moderate his passione

least 01 110 latter. The distinction between right and wrong rests
merely on utility and has nothing mysterious about 11 One chief
means 01 attaining pleasure is the society 01 friends. To enjoy this
we should cultivate the feelings 01 kindness and benevolence.
