who differ from them cir dr ὑπεναντία τῇ προλήψει δογματιζόντων’.’ Further ·

there is no attempt at accmacy in giving the opinions of the earlier

whichever reading we adopt If we insert alia after vcro with two of
Orelli’s uss, this is in the first place hardly a suitable term for what
promises to be an exhaustive disquisition on the earlier systema (ab altimo
repetam); Sola therefore (Opaca 111 305 and 359) would prefer either to
read celcra for alia, or to transfer raperhram with Dbderlein, placing it
before ab altimo, which would then be taken absolutely as inInccnt.,128

repeterem and, in the second place, all these readings are inconsistent with
the fact that a large part of the subsequent polemicis directed against
the Stoica I am inclined therefore to retain the old reading, translating
‘Such is a general statement oi the Stoic doctrines: I will now prooeed
to show how they are related to the older philosophies'3 more literally
‘to show what their character is, I will traoe back their history to its
earliest source '. Probably there may have been some Stoie history of
philosophy professing to show that their doctrines were substantially the
same as those held by the most esteemed of the earlier philosophare The
Epicureans would meet this by endeavouring to prove that such support
could only damage their cause. Fbrtsch (Queat. rell. 1837) explains it
differently, cajus vcro ριιιαιιι siat, aa ιιινιια ortanam at erordiar ab ιιὶτίιιιο
