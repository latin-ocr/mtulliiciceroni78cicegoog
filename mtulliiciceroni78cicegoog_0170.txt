01 111110 111 110011, are quite beside the mark. No one disputes that
this was the view 01 many philosophers3 the question is, what was 1110
Epicurean viewl No doubt Vell. just below uses non-Epicurean argu·
ments, but that is where he can turn them 1ο his own purpose, and make
his adversary's case destroy itself. Here it 10 his own csse which is
weakened by the insertion of what I hold to be a gloss. As regards the
language 01 1110 gloss 1100111010 cogitationem qnidam cadit is equivalent
to 110 cogitari qnidam potest (Ac1182) ‘it is impossible even 10 imagine

how there could have been (lit. was) anything 01 the nature 01 111110 before .

time existed' (I prefer 10 take it thus rather than to make nt faerit=fnisae
with Sch. in loco and Draeg. 5407). It only remains to account for the
gloss, and this seems, like animi after cerdis ξ 19, 10 be easily explained
as a correction 011110 Epicurean doctrine in the text, made by a follower
01 Plato or Aristode, who inserted a non before potest, and gave as his

reason for negativing it qnod-esset. For the use of inelle90=‘coneeive’
Heidt. quotes Fin1 11010111 motum atomorum nnita 0 principio sed 00

1211010 spatio. Why the Abl. when we have the Ace. 01 duration ·

just before, (000010 dorm.)i Because in that case the sleeping is viewed as
extending right through the ages, while here the action is viewed es con-
fined within this time, not extending over it ; so in tempore infinito just
below, cf. 1100 spatio (in the interval) 00101000 macinae (De Orat. 11 353),
cosas 001001 innumeris paena socordis in omnibns plara mirabilia qnam in
somniorum 11110 effecit (Dio. 11 147). The same difference is found in Gr.
between the Ace. of duration and the (inclusive) Gen. 01 111110. Practically
01 course 1110 two very much overlap, see Roby §§ 1182, 1185. Or we might
take spatio as the Abl 01 Attendant circumstances, ‘though there was all
that time ’‚ Roby § 1248.

at ists-parerent. Heidt. (p. 38) has called attention 10 the ap
parent inconsisteucy 01 this sentence with the tenete 01 the speaker. Γ11101
110 00111101 connect the idea 01 1011 with our idea 01 the divine nature 10 01
0011100 01 the essence 01 Epicureanism; but this is bound up with the idea
01 the divine inactivity‚ whereas here it 10 assumed that the work of creation
may be accomplished without toi] to 1110 0100101 owing 10 the willing 00
operation 01 the elements‚a supposition which hes been just ridiculed by
Vell. ξ 19. There is however 110 reason to suppose any corruption 01 the
text, as H. does. The argument throughout isod hominem as shown by

1110 repeated 1010111011το To this H. opposes the langrmge used by
Balbus 01 the labour 01 creation 11133 tarataram rernm 01011110, tamam
laborasse: the answer to which is that Β. there speaks rhetorically in a
manner opposed to the general spirit of the Stoic philosophy to which Vell.
