Zeller Epic. p. 452 tr.

quos pudeat: most of the editors spoil the irony of the passage by
inserting ιιοιι Cotta is complimenting Vell on his superiority to the
scruples oi the weaker brethren (called impetitos Fla 1 bb) who think thet
there may be pure mental pleosures entirely unconnected with the body;
cf. Fiet. 117 (Epicurus declares) τοο intellegere quedem se posse, cot nt cut

ments Callicles on his freedom from false shame (lory. 492 and 483.
Klotz Adra Or. 11 16 points out that if Vell. were ashamed oi the doctrine
referred to, there would have been no propriety in calling upon him to
justiiy and explain it, as is done in the following sentence quem cibum
igetur luc, also thet his recognition of these doctrines is stated below,

delicatis et obscenis t ‘the pleesures of the voluptuary and sensualist’,
cf Epic. περὶ retrove quoted by Diog. L. x 6 and more fully by Athen vn

of the question es to iood end drink; quidem of course points the contrast
to tc οιαοαι, On the other hand there is great harshnoss in the ns reading
mear ambasiam before ιριιίαο. It cen hardly be taken either as an
instance of asyndeton, or of appositior (es Klotz Ades Oris. 11 p. 18),
while it would be a very natural gloss lor a scribe to add. Omitting it,
we must throw the stress oi the sentence on the following clausa, referring
to the beautiful cup-hearers, otherwise the mere mention of epulae would
scarcely edd anything to what has been said before For comp. ομ. of
