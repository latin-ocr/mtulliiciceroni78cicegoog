Ab. O.'s defenoo against his critice. He had always been a .

student of philosophy, hut had only lately begun to write upon it,

· partly by way 01 useful employment in his enforoed absence from

public life, partly 11 1 solaco under his heavy loss. His manner of
expounding the different tenets of each school without stating his
own opinion was 111111111011111)7 adopted to provoke thought. Tho
Academic school to which he belonged was unfairly branded as
sceptical. It simply maintained the doctrine of probability in oppo-
sition to Stoio dogmatism. 111 5-1 12.

Ac. Preamble to the dialogue isselt In order that the reader
may he enabled to 101111 his own judgment, 0. reports a conversation

Bb. Historical Section.

i. Epicurean criticism of the theologica] tenete of twenty seven
philosophers 110111 Thales to Diogenes 01 Babylon x 25-xv 41.

ii Epicurean criticism of the popular belief, as seen in the

Bc. Epicurean exposition. Universalconsentisasufficicnt procl
of the existence, blesscdness, and immortality of the Gods. Such
Gods must be free from care and passion, and 111 to be regarded
with reverence, but without 1111. Experience and reason both assure
us that they are formed like men, but their bodies aro 01 111 finer
texture than ours, and are perceptible to tho mind alone, not to the

bodily senses That they are immortal is farther shown by the law ⁴

01 equilibrium, which provides that what is deficient in one place is
compensated 101 in another. Thus the destructive forces which pre-
vail in this mortal region are balanced by conservative forces else,
where. To believe in a divine Creator and Governor of the world is

to believe in a God who is full 01 care and trouble himself, and who Ι

causes pain to others, andis therefore an object 01 superstitious 1111.
The God of Epicurus passas his time in tranquil contemplation, while
worlds aro made and unmade by the fortuitous movements 011111111-
merahle atoma throughout the infinity 01 space. xvr 43-xx 56.
