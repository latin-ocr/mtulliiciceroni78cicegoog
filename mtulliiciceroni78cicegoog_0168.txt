them is that the Demiurgus is pure spirit and exista apart from the
world which he creates, while Pronoea is strictly an attribute of the fiery
soul which animates the world, and from which the world grows as a plant
from a seed [This again shows that oestro cannot be predicative, ior there
is no place ior agents and instrumenta (minsitros, machinos) in this natural
aud necessary growth.] The Stoic Providence therefore is not eadm, bnt
alio, and Veli asks why, if the universe thus contains in itself its own
principle of life, it· should fail to be eterna13 ior the Stoica thought (N. D.
11 118) that it was destined ιο be destroyed by fire. The answer is that
this destruction is merely the cyclical re·absorption of the universe, as
it grows old, into its original iorm oi fire, from which it issues forth iu

religion, admits the justice oi this objection against a creation at any par-
ticular moment oi time, and qnotes an interesting passage from Neander
in reference ιο Origen's opinionon the subject: ‘supposing that ιο create

conformable ιο God's nature should at any time have been wantingl Why
should not those attributes which belong to the very essence of the Deity,
his almighty power and goodness, be always activel a transition from the
state of non-creating to the act of creation is inconceivable without a
change, which is incompatible with the being of God', Bampton Leot. 11

omnipresent in time as in space. We go back in thought to the commence-
