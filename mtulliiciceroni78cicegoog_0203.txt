ξ 37 Aristo: of Chios (Krische 404-415) represents a Oynic reae

tion in the Stoic school; he confined himself exclusively to ethics on the
ground that logie was a spider's web, curicus but useless, and that physics
were beyond our faculties : Stob. Floril. 80, 7 πρὸς ἡμᾶς μὲν εἶναι τὰ ἠθικά,
μὴ πρὸς ἡμᾶς τὰ διαλεκτικά· μὴ γὰρ συμβάλλεσθαι πρὸς ἐπανόρθωσιν βίον· ὑπὲρ
ἡμᾶς δὲ τὰ φυσικθ ἀδύνατα γᾶρ ἐγνῶσθαι καὶ οὐδὲ παρέχειν χρείαν. Itis
therefore probably correct, though vve have no actual confirmation from
other sources, that he denied the possibility oi our knovving anything about
God The particular form given to the denial is of course due to the
Epicurean reporter.
’ Cleanthes: Krische 415-436. Ηο is referred to N. D. 11 13, 111 16
(the four grounds of religious belief) 11 24 and 40 (all-pervading heat) 11 63,
11163 (allegorieal interpretation). Cleanthes is more distinguished for
moral strength and religione earnestness than for any speculative edvance τ
none of the doctrines here mentioned ere peculiar to him: one in fect is
wrongly ascribed to him While holding with the rest ol his school that
the universe was divine in virtue of the aetherial soul by which it was
animated, he placed the source and seat of aether in the sun, and not as
the others (agreeing with Aristotle) in the furthest heaven, cf. Aa 11 126
Zenoni et reliquas sere Stoicis aether uidetur summm deus, luente praeditus
que macha requietem Oleaetlwa, qui quasi majorum est pestium Stoicus,
solem dominere et rerem potiri putam Stob. Ecl. 1 21 Κλ. ἐν ἡλίῳ ἔφησεν
εἶναι τὸ ἡγεμονικὸν τοῦ κόσμου.

extremum: to be taken predicatively with stuperatem, ‘inclosing on the
outside.'

uui-nominetur. Heind prefers the Ind considering that this is an
addition of the reporters, and not spart of the speech reported3 but the
Subj. is an exact translation of such a speech as we find D'iog. L. v11 137
λέγει Ζήνων ἀνωτάτω μὲν εἶναιτὸ πῦρ, ὃ δὴ αἰθέρα καλεῖσθαι, ἐν qi πρωτην τὴν
τῶν ἀπλανῶν σφαῖραν γεννᾶσθαι, εἶτα τὴν τῶν πλανωμένων. (λέ own view is
nearly the same Rep. vr 17 νιονοπι tibi orbibus concae suat omnia, quorem
unus est coeletis, eclimus qui reliquos omnes complectitur, seramus ipse deus
arcem et mediceae ceteros.

quasi delirans-voluptatem The word del. is properly used of
dotage‚ ae in Senectutem senilis stultitia quae deliratio appellari solet:
so oeus delire Dio. 11 141, Tuae. 148. For the tropical use see ξ 42.
Vell waxes vehement as he thinks of the attack made upon the Epicureans
in Ole’s treatise melitonis Diog. L. vn 37, 175.

fingit formam quandam:thispr0bab1y refers to the anthropomorphic
language used by Ole. in speaking of God, as in the grand hymn to Zeus,
τοῖον ἔχεις ὖπὸεργον ἀνικήτοις ε’νὶ χερσὶν Ι θμφὴκη, πυρόεντα, θειζῶοντιι
κεραυνόν. In such words Cle. gives, as it were (quaedem, cf. n on quodam
§ 33) a human form (cf. aella species ξ 34) to Zeus

divinitatem omnem: ‘complete divinity’; omnia qualitative, not
quantitative.
