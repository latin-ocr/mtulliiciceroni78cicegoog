had to bring into subjection. Ii it succeeded, it returned to its
star on the death oi the body, if it failed, it was destined to
undergo various transmigrations until its victory was complete. In
111 these physical speculatione Plato was much influenced by the

Pythagoreans.
We have now to speak of his ethical doctrines, which were

based upon the psychologieal views mentioned above. The seul is
on a small scale what the State or city is on a large scale: it is a
constitution which is in its right condition when its parts work
harmonicusly together, when the governing reason is warmly sup

ported by its auxiliary the heart, and promptly and loyally obeyed
by the appetitos. Thus perfect virtue arises when wisdom, comaga
and temporanee are bound together by justice. The highest good 11

11911101111111911110, Tace. 1 22) was born at Stagira,a Greek colony in
Thrace, in the year 38510. He came 10 Athens in his 17111 year
and studied under Plato for twenty years. In 343 rac. he was
invitad by Philip, King of Macedon, to superintend the edueation

called Peripatetics On the death of Alexander, Aristotle left Athens
to escape from a charge of impiety‚ and settled at Chalcis in Euboea,
where he died 322 110.

Aristotle's philosophy may be roughly described as Plato put into
prose and worked out in detail. The vagae mysticism, the high
poetic imagination, of the master was altogether alien to the
scholar, but the main lines 01 the two systema are the same.
Plate’s Dialectie method was developed by Aristotle inte the
strict technical scienee of Legic: Plato’s Ideas were shorn 01 their
separate supra-mundane existence and became the first of the four
famous Oauses 01 Α11110110, the formal, the material, the efficient, the
linal, which are really four kinds 01 antecedent conditione required
