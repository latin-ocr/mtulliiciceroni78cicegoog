The physicul theory of the Stoics is a pcrctlrcr'atic westmialr'sm.
The only real existences are such as can act and be acted upon, and
these are bodies, for like can only act on like. But these bodies arc
not moved simply by mechanical lawa, as Democritus supposed. The
whole universe is an cmbodied spiritual force, of which we may call
one part passive, one part active, but all is slike material. The
active portion is soul, aliery ether pervading the whole, but having
its principal seat in the heaven which encompasses it on every side;
the passive portion consiste mainly of the inferior clemente, water
and earth. These latter proceed from the former and are periodically
reabsorbed into it in the worldconflagration The universe itself,
as a perfect living creature, is rightly called God, but the name
is more particularly given to the soul of the universe, who is also
known by many descriptiva appellatione, Rational or Artistic Fire
(πῦρ νοερόν, πῦρ τεχνικόν), All-penetrating Air, Spirit, Reason, Nature,
vaidence, Destiny, Law, Necessity‚ the Ruling Principle (τὸ ἦγε-
μονικόν), and, with reference to his creative and ‘informing’ power,

ἢ the Generative Reason (λόγος σπερματικός). The gods of the popular

religion represented different activities of the one true Deity. The
human soul isan emanation from Him. Although it outlivcs the
body, it will only retain its individual existence till the next con·
flagration, and that only in the case ol the wisc. The stare being
made of pure fire are divine.

In all this vve see the influence ol Heraclitus, who was much
quoted by the Stoica, though the distinction of the active and
passive elementa in the universe has been with some probability
referred back to the Aristotelian distinction between Form and
Matter. They agreed with Aristotle also in holding the unity‚
finiteness and-sphericity of the world, but, unlike him, considered
that there was an unlimited void beyond it. That which was
peculiarly Stoical was the strong moral colom-ing which they gave
to their materialistic system. The all-pervading fire was at the
same time the all-seeing Providence who created and governed all
things for the best ends, and makes each several existence, each
several fact, conspire together for the good of the whole. It is the
privilege of man to be able knowingly and willingly to act as a
rational part of the rational whole, instead of yielding himself up
to irrational and selfish impulse: but however he acts, he must
perlorce carry out the divine purpose, as Cleanthes says in his noble
hymn:
