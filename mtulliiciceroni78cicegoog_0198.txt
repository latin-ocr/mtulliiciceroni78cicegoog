ubi coc di: Heind. (followed hy Sch. Opaca 111 311) thinks that, as tot
cannot applyto the four above mentioned (which in reality are only two, the
· κινοῦν and κινούμενον), something must have been lost from the text; and
as Arist. is said conducendae from his master, he suggests that the lost
clause may have corresponded with δ 30 quos majorum instatura} accepimus.
But why may we not give the same meaning to uli tot viu ‘all those many
Gods of the popular religiou', without supposing an emissioni (So Allan),
The Epicurean objectiou would then be that ‘these gods are supposed to
exist in heaven, but if heaven itself is uod, how can one god live in
another’f If we accept Soh's conjecture that the lost clause referred to
the atara, the objection would merely be a repetition of coctum muudi ease
purtem: ‘they are already included in caelum, how ean they be separato
and independent Gods’l

numeramus: similarly nr 40, 43.

curean views of incorporeal substance (roua priam) have been sufficiently
ι illustrated already.
