with Madv.’s n. and ib. 72 where Torquatus defends his master’s neglect of
puerile studies; also Zeller Stot'os tr. p. 397 foll, and Dtining Metrodorus
p. 64 foll on the rsteem in which the Epicureans held the poete. Gassendi
in his treatise De ot'ta et moretm Epicuri examines at length the charges
'here made against Ep. and endeavours to show that they are mere alaudem
of rival philosophare. In dealing with such a question, there are two
points which should be borne in mind, (1) that knowledge which has been
systematized and authoritatively taught is liable to a sort of ossifioation in
the hands ol formalists and pedants, and (2) that, as each fresh advance in
knowledge bears more or less the character ol a revolt agmnst knowledge
established and authoritative, a certain amount of sslf-confideres and want
ol appreciation for previous knowledge is not unusual in reformare or dis·
coverera So Hobbes ‘boasted ol the smullness of his acquaintance with
preceding writers, declering that ifhe had read as much as other men
he should have been as dull ol witus they were', Whewell beot. om Mor.
Pte. p. 43. We may therefore excusa Ep. if he condemned too severely
, the artificia] poetry, the frivolous rhetoric, and the hair-splitting logie ol
his time. Il he spoke contemptuously ol these as ol no use for life, he has
done no more than the Stoio Seneca in his seth epistle, anam stadium rere
liberale eet qaod labatem facit: cetera patto et patritiorum and again,
quid qaod ista liberalium artium concertatio molestos, verbosos, intempestivos,
wttptaames facit, et ideo nort darmaee rmcmsarr'a qam supervacua didice-
rant? as he shows in detail in the same epistle. That the ‘liberal arts'
were not· entirely neglected by the followers of Epicurus appears from the
large number of treatises on rhetoric, music, poetry and dialectic, which

have been found among the Herculanean papyri. But Philodemus, to
whom most ol them are assigned, shares his masters contempt for a pro-

· lession of universal knowledge (such as was made by Hippias), comparing

the ‘polyhistore’ of his time to the Homeric Margites, see his De Vitas
