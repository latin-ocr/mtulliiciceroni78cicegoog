man explanation of the belief of the vulgar, the absurdities of which
are shortly after pointed out: how far Lucretius himself allowed eviden-
tial weight to these visione is not clear. In 1v 26 foll. he gives as his
reason for discussing the nature of the images (αι’ννιιιῖαανα) the fact that
they take the shape of the dead and cause terror by presenting themselves
to us both awake and asleep, referte animus Acherunte reamur Ι effugere aut
ιινηῦτιις iater- riuos volitare Ι , andin 722 foll. he shows how such οίπιυίαονιι
may arise spontaneously in the air. It seems therefore that these images
can only be trusted in so far as they are supported by abstract reasoning.
Compare also Sext. Emp. Mate. rx 25 (quoted by Munro) Ἐπίκουρος δὲ εἰι
ταῖν κατὰ τοὺς ὕπνους φαντασιῶν οἴεται τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἔννοιαν ε’σπακένιιι θεοῦ·
μεγάλων γὰρ εἰδώλων, φησί, καλ ἅνθρωπομὸρφων κατὰ rods ὕπνους προσπιπτόν-
των θπέλοβον καὶτοῖς ἀληθείαις ὑπάρχειν τινὰς τοιούτους θεοὺς ἅνθρωπομθρ·
dovr. The Stoic Balbus is in agreement with Epic. on this point; and
dristctle (quoted by Sextus lc.) made these appearances one of the two
causes to which he traces the origines religion, dab δυοῖν ἆρχῶυ ἔννοιαν θεῶν
ἔλεγε γεγονέναι, ἀπό τε τῶν περὶ τὴν ψυχὴν συμβαινόντων καλ ἀπὸ τῶν μετεω-
ριυν, the former owing to rods εὐ τοῖς ὕπνοις γιγνομένους ταύτης ἐνθουσιασμοὺς
καλ τὰς μαντείας· ὅταν γάρ, φησίν, ἐν τῷ θπνοῦν καθ’ tueris γένηται ἡ ψυχή,
τότε τὴν ἰδίαν ἀπολαβοῦσα φύσιν it exercises a pmphetie power, just as
Homer tells us it does at the moment of death ; ἐκ retrorsit ὑπενόησαν ol
ἅνθρωποι εἶναι’ τι θεὸν τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν εὀικός τῇ ψυχη καὶ πάντων ἐπιστημονικό-
τατον. See H. Speneer Prirwiplcs ⁰s Socioloyy eh. x and Tylor quoted
below.

rumas notiones: answering to autera above. We find the correspond-
ing Greek term used of the προλήψεις in Diog. L. x 38 α’νόγκη γὰρ τὸ πρῶτον
ε’ννὸημιι καθ’ ἕκαστον φθόγγον βλέπεσθαι καλ μηθὶν ἄποδεῖξεως προσδεῖσθαι
(if we are to have any standard of reference).

ne omnia-ud primas notiones The πρόληψις which arisae instinct·
ively from the repeated appearancee of Gods is contrasted with the ab·
etract reasonings which follow. The Gods must be of human sliape, fer
the most perfect nature must be also the most beautiful, and the lurnrau
shape is more beautiful than any othor; again, happiness cannot exist
without virtue, nor virtue without reason, nor reason except iu human
shape. The former argument is criticiaed ξ 77-eo, tlie latter § 87- 81).

§dt praesentissimam: ‘we are justified iu believing that the rrriwt
exalted of beings, whether we regard his happiness or hie eternity, ruint lie
also (οονιαῐιπι) the most beautiful'. It would seem that both here eud iu § ea
we must explain the eausal clauses ecl qaia and cam ot αιιιννια by arelerence
to μναιαίους.

figura: the mathematica] outline‚a matter of fact3 speciae, outward
appearance as distinguished from the inner nature ; ferma (ξ 48), the ferni
artistically viewed as symbolizing the inner nature.

vos endem—divinam: ‘you Stoice at least aro went, in displayiug
the skill of the divine artificer’‚ soe 11 87 and 134, aud forfubr. 5 19 n.
