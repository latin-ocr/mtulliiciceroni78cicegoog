homo nemo: 11111111 11961111 Madv. § 91.

1 79. etquidem: ‘ yes, and ant like ant'. This formula is often used
to express an ironica] acceptance of an opponent's argument, professing to
carry it further but really showing that it is applicabis in an opposite sense
to that intended by the usar ; cf Dia 11 114 (in answer to an argument for
divination) noune 11 praedixit quaefacta sum? Ille cero,· 11 eu quidem
quoe omues timebamus ,· N. D. 1 100 (against the argument for anthropomor-
phism from innata ideas) bdbebnm iuscrumtiouem quuudmm dei Et barbati

quiden 11111· Fim 135 (to prove that Torquatus was not forgetful of ex·
pediency) torquem detraxit hosti. Et quidem 11 1111111 interiret, (see

Madv. iu loc. and Emeud. p. 111111, Moser on 1111111 48, Draeg.§ 311
13). It is used to emphasize without irony in §§ 55, 59, 88 11 quidem 1111,
8311 quidem laudamus, 8911 libenter quidem. The ironical meaning is
also found in quidem alone, 11 1118111 Ρ1111111, at Apollodorus poenus
11111111. Multis quidem 1111 menti 11 11111111 ; and in 11 alone, as 111 27

orationem also in 1111111111 Lucr. 1809, V15743 see Draeg. 1 341, Bake '
and Dumesnil on Ley. 111 24.

formica: allusion is again made to the autin 11 158, 111 21; similarly
Celsus ap. Orig. compares it with man as affording an instance of civil life
(lv 77, 81), and of forosight (ib. 83), and argues that in the sight of God
the two must be much on a level (ab. 85).

quotus qunque. As tertius 1., 11111111111111 ‘each third ', ‘each
fourth man', so q. q. means strictly ‘each bmr-marcy-ett', 1. e. ‘ono out of
how large a number’, ‘what a small fraction'. ’

Athenis cum essem: probably referring to 79 aa, when Ο. attended
lecturas there in company with Atticus and other friends3 so in § 59 and
1 93 he ascribes his own experience 1ο Cotta

ememtes-singuli: ‘soarce one in each company’ (the σύστρεμμα
numbering about 15 privates, see Dumont Eesui aur dprebie Attique), so
Tuae. v 77 adulescentium greges lacedaemone cedimus ipsi incredibili 111111
tione certantes. An Athenian was strictly ἔφηβος from the ageos 18 to 20,
druing which time he had to serve 11 περίπολος, but tho term was loosely
used of youths after 16, when they commenced their regular training in
the gymnasia Hermann (111111. 1 § 176 speaks of the increesed import-
ance attached to the organisation of the Ephebi aiter the loss of liberty
and under the Roman power. The Latinized form is freely used by Varro
and the comic poets. Grec here just corresponds to the Cretan dydoy: it
11 technically used of a company of actors

1111111111 ‘you smila at the confession of my weakness’.

concedentibus-delectamur. Compare the partly ironical and playful
professione of admiration which abound in the Platonic dialogues, ag.
t'bnmm p. 154 c, hyris 204 133 and see Thompson’s Pbaedma App. 1, Zeller
