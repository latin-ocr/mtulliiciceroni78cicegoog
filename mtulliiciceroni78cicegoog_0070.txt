and giving riso to a wrong pronunciation. He quotes hexameter
lines containing the words obiciebat, conicere, subicit, and says many
readers lengthen the first vowel in order to make the lines scan, but
cb, ceu and sub are essentially short syllables and only lengthened
by the consonant which follows, secunde enim luere iu bie cubis per
duo i, uesper uuum scribenda est ‚· uuru uerbum ipsum nou eet ‘ieie'
sed ‘iccio' et praeteritum ucu ‘icit' fucit, red ‘iecit ’. Id ubi compo

‘incipio', utque itu¹ rim consonantis capu, et idcirco eu syllaba pro

patirur. Then he goes on to say that quod upred Veryilium pontem
invenimus ‘inice', sic esce ‘iniiee', ut supra diui, et scribendum et
leyercdurn ruamur. I should wish therefore to keep the spelling
with j in all except the rare cases in which the consonantal i cesses
tc exercise any influence on the quantity of the preceding syllable, as
in reice Verg. Ecl. 111 96, edice Mart. 1182 1. In such exceptional
ceses the spelling would be changed as in other cases of syncope
or diaeresis.

APPENDIX ΟΝ DAVIES’ MSS.

It isacuu‘ous fact that, of the six MSS used by Davies for his
edition of the Nuturu Deorum, viz. the Oodecc Beyius Bp. Moere's
copy oi the Stephanus edition containing two marginal collatione
(styled by Davies Codices Elieueea), the ns lent to him by Dr Richard
Mend (Med.) and those belonging to the Cambridge University
Library (Cant.) and to the Library of Lincoln College, Oxford (ΗΜ),
all but the two last have disappeared. In order to sava trouble to
others who may be interested in the text of Cicero, and also in the
hope that possibly some one among my readers may be able to sup
plement my account with further information, I print here all that
I have been ableto ascertain about the history of the lost uss

In the Preface to the lst edition of the NJ). 1718, Davies de·
scribes the Oodd El. as follows: usum editionis Stephanicae curn
duobus optimis nss collatae dedi eunenme neci, dum iu uiris erat,
patronus, Jounuea Morere, nuper Elieueis Episcopus. Ten years
later, in the Preface to his edition oi the De Legibus, he speaks more
