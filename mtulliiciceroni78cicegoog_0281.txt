- ῑ aberrant a conlectura: ‘miss their aim’. This is 1110 reading 01011 1110
1100, but Scb following Walker omits tho preposition, and translates ‘go
wrongintheir guessing'. In his Opaca 111 321 and 367 hestoutly maintains
(against Wopkens, Heind. and ,Klotz Adra Gra. 11 12) that the other reading
makes nonsense3 and he would therefore correct 12 Pla. 23 acac, quaeso,

00 aiiii 0 cordatum, aberrem, where Wesenberg keeps the preposition Ι have
myself very little iaith in 111000 0 priori reasonings es to the impossibility
010 word acquiring any particular use. It seems to me more improbable
that 1110 scribes should in several passages have inserted the proposition,
without any inducement that Ι 0011 000, 11101111010001101010011011111οο1110 10

irrational superstition or into atheism.
