soon 1 cn. x1 § 27. 111

non vidit—mundo. Epicurean polemio : if each soul is a part of the
divine seul, then (1) the separate existence of human souis must cause a
laceration of the universal soul‚ (2) when the individual soul is conscious oi
pain, a part of divinity is in pain, (3) each seul must parteke in the infinite
knowledge of the universal seul, (4) it is impossible that au incorporeal
soul could be united with a material world. For obj. (l) ef ξ 24 dci rrrcmbra
ardentia: it is of course merely straining the metaphor of carperetur.
Both this and the following obj. are based on the Epicurean assumption cf
perfect happiness as essential to divinity. On the Epicurean pessimism
(qaod pleresque contingeret) see ξ 83η. obj. (4) is inapplicable : the writers
who attribute to P. the derivation of the human seul from the divine
represent him as materializing both under the form of fire or aether.

distractione: Ba adopts Ruhnken's conjecture detractione referring
to the separation oi each soul from the universal soul ; but the us reading
may be defended as expressing the division of· the universal soul among a
number of human souis : animoa detrahitur olc cicc, but daus distrahitur in
carmos.

infinity of the universe Arist (Met. Δ. 986 b.) distinctly tells us that while
Parmenides made the One πεπερασμένον, regarding it from the ideal side,
and Melissus, regarding it from the material side, made it ἄπειρον, Xeno
phanes οὐθέν διεσαφήνισεν ἀλλ’ εἶς τὸν ὅλον ου’ρανὸν ἀποβλέψας τὸ έν εἶναι’
φησι τὸν θεόν. In the Aristotelian treatise, Melissae, however (0.4) it is
argued that, if God is spherical (as X. affirmed) he must also be finite,
σφαιροειδῆ ὅντα α’νὰγκη πέρας ἔχειν, whence later writers attributed this
doctrine to him, eg. Galen, Hac. Pl, 111 14εἴναι πάντα έν,κοῖ τοῦτοῦπόρ
χειν θεὸν πεπερασμένον, λογικὸν, ἀμετάβλητον. On the other hand we reati
(Melies. 2) that X. supposed the earth 1ο extend downwards and the air

upwards 10 infinity which may have giuen risa to the representation of his
doctrine here followed by O. or this may have arisen, as Krische thinks
(p. 91) from the confusion between the infinite in time (ἀίδιον) and the

infinite in space (ἄπειρον) cf. Meliss. 1, and Zeller 1⁴ 494. One might have
expected to find some reference here 10 the noble protest made by Xen.
against the debesing ideas connected with the popular religion, but the
Epicureans in their allusione to other philosophare only thought oi exalting
their own master, and Xen’s ridicule of anthropomorphism would make
his writiugs especially distestefirl to them The fragments of Xen were
collected and explained by Karsten, 1830.
