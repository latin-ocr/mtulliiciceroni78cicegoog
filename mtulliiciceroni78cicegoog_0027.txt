Perre, the ‘decu plriloaoplrorum' (N. D. 11 32), was bornat
Athens 428 rac. and became a disciple oi Socrates in 408 uc. After
the death of his master he left Athens and lived at Megara with
Euclides. From thence he visited Cyrene, Egypt, Magna Graecia
aud Sicily. After nearly ten years of travelling he took up his
residence again at Athens and began to lecture iu the gymnasium
of the Academia He died in his eightieth year.

Building on the foundation of Socrates, he insiste no less than his
master on the importance of negative Dialectic, as a means of testing
commonly received opinions 3 indeed most oi his Dialogues come to
no positive result, but merely serve to show the difficulties of the
subject discussed aud the unsatisfactory nature of the solutions
hitherto proposed. As he makes Socrates the spokesman in almost
all the Dialogues, it is not always easy to determine precisely where
the line is to be drawn between the purely Socratic and the Platonic
doctrine, but the general relation oi the one to the other may be
stated as follows. ’

In his theory of knowledge Plato unitas the Socratis definition
with the Heraclitean Becoming and the Eleatic Being. Agreeing'
with Heraclitus that all the objects of the sauses are fleeting and
unreal in themselves, he held that they are nevertheless participant
of Being in so far as they represent to us the general terms after
which they are named. Thus we can make uo general assertion with
regard to this or that concrete triangular thing: it is merely a
passing sensation: but by abstraction we may rise from the concrete
to the contemplationes the Ideal triangle, which is the object oi
science, and concerning which we may make universal and absolutely
true predicatione. If we approach the Ideal from below, from the
concrete particulare, it takes the form of the class, the common name,
the definition, the concept, the Idea3 but this is an incompleta view
of it. The Ideal exists apart from, and prior to, all concrete em-
bodiment. It is the eterual archetype of which the seusible objecta
are the copies It is because the soul in its praexistent statuis
already familiar with this archetype that it is capable of being
reminded of it when it sees its shadow in the phenomeual existentes
