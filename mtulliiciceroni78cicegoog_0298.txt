ξ 18 to Democritus in 5 19, Schwencke (p. 61) thinks that O. here departs
from his author (as he often does where he wishes tc enliven tha dismissmn
by a quotation) perhaps through a reminiscenoe of Teuc. 1 29 quaere quarum
dcuwuetreutar sepulcra iu Graecia, reminescere, quautam ee initiatur, quae
tradamur mysteria, where the tombs of the gods are also brought into
juxtaposition with the mysterius. On the general subject of the mysteries,
see Dbllinger l. c. 130-200, and Lobeck Aglaophamue.

sanctam illam 11 cunnum. Ο. and Atticus were initiated, as we
learn from Lep. 11 36, where the beneficiat influence of the mysteriesis

thus spoken of ε uam milti cum multa eximia diuiuaqm videatur Athenae

eumue, iurataque ut appellantur, ita re aera principia uitae cognevimus, aeque
solum cum laetitia uiuendi rationem accepimus, aad etiam cum epe multare
auertenda· and in the preceding paragraph, discussing the prohibition of
nocturnal worship, he aska quid crgo aget Iaccltus Eumolpidaaqua matri et
auquaa illa mysteria, ei qur'alcm saera turturea tollimus? On the special
force of the word auymtm see Ov. Faet. 1 609 carrata uocaut augusta patres,
augusta vocamur Ι templa sacerdotum rite ducta mauu Ι ,· it is joined, as
here, with sauctae in 1162, 111 53.

ubi initiantur-ultimae. It is not known from whence this iambic
line is taken Orarum is the Inclusive (partitive) Genitive aiter ultimae,
which I take as Nom. PL agreeing with gemes, not (as Sch apparently) as
Gen. Sing. It is loosely added, like lucorum terrarum, dra, to define the
meaning of ult. With regard to the admissicn to the mysterius, Isocrates
Pauey. 42 mentions that barbadam were not allowed to be initiated, but
the rule seems to have been relaxed in later times, as in the 111111 0.;
indeed Lobeck considers that any one already initiated was at liberty
to introduce a friend of whatever nationality (p. 28 foll), so that the wonl
avoruyoytrcame to mean no more than araone. But the form cf initia
tion was always required, the uninitiated could only enter the temple at
the peril of their lives, as is shown by the fate of the two Acamanians
whose death led to the wrir between Athens and Macedonia aa. 200
(Liv. xxx114).

Samothraciam-Lemni: these islands together with Imbros were
the seat of the Oabiric worship, on which see Dan l. a p. 1641111, Lobeck
Ayt. p. 1109-1329, PrellerOr. Mytla 1660-673. Herodotus 11 51 is the
first who mentions the Samothraciam mysteriea Preller thinks that these
were not of much importanoe till aiter the Persian War, and that they
were partly copied from the Eleusinia Aristophanes (Pae 278) speaks of
the Samothracien initiation as a saleguard in danger ; especially at sea, as
we leam from other sources, cf. N. D. 11189. Under the Macedonian and
Roman rule (partly owing to the supposed connexion of Rome with Troy)
these mysteries were continually growing in importanoe. See niv. xnv. b,
