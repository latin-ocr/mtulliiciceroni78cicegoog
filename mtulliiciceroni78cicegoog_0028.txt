GREEK PHILOSOPHY. XXV

which make up the world of sense*. All knowledge is reminiscence.
What cannot be traced back to this intuitivc consciousness in the
sou] itself is not knowledge, but mere opinion. Dialectic is the
means by which the soul is enabled to recover the lost consciousness
of the Ideal. The highest Ideal, which is the foundation of all
existence and all knowledge is the Ideal Good, personified as (lod.
He, as the Creator or Demiurgus, formed the universe by imprinting
the ideas on the formless chaotic Matter. The process of creation is
described in the Timaeus under the form of a myth, Plato holding,
like Parmenides, that it was not possible to arrivc at more than
a symbolical adumbration of physical trutb. The cause and ground
of creation is the goodness of (lod, who sceks to extend his own
blessedness as widely as possible. He begins his work by con-
structing the soul of the world out of the two elementa before
’ him, the immutable harmonicus Ideals and changing discordant
Matter. This soul be infuses into the mass of matter, wbicb there
upon crystallinos into the geometrical forms of the four elements, and
assumes the shape of a perfect sphera rotating on its axis. The
Kosmos thus created is divine, imperishable and infinitely beautiful
Further, each clement is to have living creaturos belonging to it.
These belonging to the element of fire are the Gods, both the
heavenly bodies and those of whom tradition tells us. All these
were fashioned by the Demiurgus himself, but tha creatures be
longing to the other elementa, including the mortal partos man,
were the work of the created gods. The immortal part of man,
the reason, is of like substance with the sonl of the world, and was
distributed by the Demiurgus amongst the stara till the time came
for each several particle to enter the body prepared for it by the
created gods, where it combined with two other ingrediente, the

* Tha render will remember the magnificent ode in which Wordsworth has
embodied Plato’s sublima conception. The lact which underlies it was well
illustrated by the late Prof. Sadgwick, commenting on Locke’s saying that “ the
mind previous to experiance is a sheet of white paper” (the old rosc tabula),
“Naked becomes from his mother’s womb, endowed with limbs and sensas
indeed, well fitted to the material world, yet powerless from want of nse: and
as for knowledge, his soni is one unvaried blank; yet has this blank been
already touched by a celestial haud, and when plunged in the colours which
surround it, it takes not its tinge from accident, but deeign, and comes forth
covered with a glorious pattern.”-Discoarse p. 53. The common-sense Philo·
sophy of the Scotch and the ὰ priori judgmants of Kant are other forms of the
same doctrine. '
