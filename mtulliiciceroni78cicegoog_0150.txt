otiam, his forced inactiou under the autocracy of Caesar, as an excuse for
turning to literature, e. g. in a letter to Verre, Fons 11 6 qais acre dedant

losophy, Amafinius, Rabirius and (latius, are always mentioned in terms oi ’
contempt, as in Acca. 1 5, Fam. xv 16 and 19, Tusa 1v 6 (where the
popularity of the first is said to have produced a crowd of imitatore).
Probably Brutus, ιο whom the N. D. is addressed, may be one of those
