64, and may suppose both to have been similarly stated by Posidonius,
though he expressed his own assent 10 the latter 3 that Cle motive
100 maintaining the other view in g 85 was probably the wish 10 give
his own experienee on the subject; lastly that the anti-Stolo remarks
are no more than were required in order 10 give the proper colour-
ing to a speech put in the mouth 01 an Academic; that they occur
sometimes in purely Stoic passages 3 that in general the Stoic writers
form the store-honse from which (l. borrows his arguments against
Epicurus, whilst he attacks the Stoice themselves with weapons
forged by the Academy, as in the De Finibus· that in the present
treatise this isforeshadowed by the lauguage used 01 the Epicurean
doctrines in 5 3, 01 the Stoic in 3 4 3 that Euhemerism is not the same
as Stoicism, and that the observatione about the mysteries are an

, interpolation 01 Cicero’s (see my nn. on 5 119). 800 further, as 10

§a TEXT AND ORTHOGRAPIIY.

The text which I have given agrees in the main with that 01
1100 latest editor, O. F. W. Miller, Teubner, 1878, but ΙΙ have
endeavoured throughout 10 weigh the evidence, iuternal and ex·
ternal, 100 each reading 10 1100 best of my ability ; and I have in
some instances retained the reading 01 the MSS, where it had been
altered by Miiller in common with all the recent editors. Thus
I have thought it unnecessary 10 insert a second eadem before requiro
in ᾗ 21, and I have three times ejected a noa which they had
inserted, before potest in§ 21, before ailad in ἓ 93, before 0001001
10οἓ 111. Elsewhere Ihave ventured on transposition 01 sentences

asin ἓὲὂ, 30 and 973 and on emendations 01 words, as in ἓξ 26, ,

49, 71. In the critical notes my object has been to put the reader
in possession 01 the requisite data for forming an independent jndg-
ment on the text As a foundation I have given the more im-
portant 01 the readings contained in the and ed. of Orelli, brought
out under Baiter’s supervision in 18613 but, though the Mss
(ΑΒΟΕΡ)ι there cited supply the principal material for determining
the text 01 the lst book 01 the N.D., they dc not seem to me to
