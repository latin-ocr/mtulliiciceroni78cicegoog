cdxl τῶν ἐπιφανῶν κατεσκέδασαν ; similarly Plut(tl.1108) describes the
treatise of Colotes, entitled arpi τοῦ ὅτι κατὰτὰ τῶν φιλοσόφων δόγματα
odda* ζῆν ἔστιν, as a πίνακα τεράτων, consisting of parts of sentences wrosted
hom their natural signification and spiced with rudeness and buffoonery.
Even 0., though far from mealy-mouthed, makes a protest against the
abusiveness of Greek controversy, Fin. 11 801111 ieta ia Graecorum hodae
perversitaa,'qai mandalia innectantur coc a quibusda cordate diaconiam.
Phaedoni-male dixerit: Ph. was a well-born native of Elis, taken
prisoner and sold as a slave in Athens nc. 401, where he attracted
the notice of Socrates and was ransomed by one of his disciples. He was
present whilst Soc. uttered the famous discourse on immortality which is
known to us as the Phaedo. Some time after his masters death he
returned to Elis, and founded the Elcan school of philosophy, which
appears to have been closely allied with those of Eretria and Megaris.
We read of a treatise of Epicurus which bore the name of διαπορίιιι πρὸς
τοὺς Μεγαρικούς, and it is possible that Phaedo may have been criticized in
this The epithet carpasiae refers, we may suppose, to the degradation
he underwent as a slave, as Diog. (11 105) tells us of another opponent
who 1111111111 him with this misiortune, cf. Zeller, Socrates p. 279 11.
Timocratem: a disciple oi Ep. described as fickle (Diog. x 6) and hoe
tempered (Philod Dc Ira Gomp. p. 48), who leit him in consequence of a
difference of opinion as to the grounds of happiness, cf. ξ 113. Duening
(Metrodorus p. 23) thinks that the quotations there given are from aheatise
by his brother Metrodorus περὶ τοῦ μείζονα εἶναι τὴν παρ’ ἡμᾶς αἰτίαν πρὸς
εὐδαιμονίαν τῆς ίκ τῶν πραγμάτων, and that Metr. is not there contrasting
hodily and mental pleneme, but pleasure which originatas ab intra with
that which originates ab caera, but see Hirzel p. 165 foll. Other grounds
ol quarrel are mentioned by Duening p. 241 After this breach Timoc seems
to have used every affort to injure his former associatos, charging them

with debauchery of every kind in his Euphranta, as well as invcighing .
