rhama The statement here made as to the two principles assumed
<by T. is opposed 1ο all the more ancient authorities. Thus Aristotle
(Metapa Δ. 3) makes him the leader of those who started from ona
material principle, and contrasts Anaxagoras with all his predecessore
aa having first felt the need of a separate intelligent principle. Itis true
that by water Τ. understood something more than mere lifeless matter
moved by mechanioal causes, like the atoms 01 Democritus Water was
a living substance endued with a θεία δύναμις κινητική (Stob. Ecl. 156)
whence Aristotlc says (de Aa. 1 5 17) καὶ ἕν τῷ ὅλῳ τινὲς ψυχὴν μεμῖχθαί
φασιν, ὅθεν ἴσως καὶ 611λῆ101161) πάντα πλήρη θεῶν εἶναι, 10 which O. alludes
·Leq.1126; but the system was a pure ‘hylozoism'. It was therefore bya ’
inere misunderstanding that later compilare such as Stobaeus, lc. aad
Plutarch Plac. Phil. 1 7 p. 881 a, attributed 1ο T, who left no writings bo·
hind him, (Diog. 1. 1 23) the statement that God was the soul 01 the world.
C. here departs even further from the truth in his phrase qaae ear aqua
coacto fingeret, implying a distinct creation 0110111011 matter by sorae
external force. Elsewhere he gives the usual 010011111111118 1710111110
-aqaa dixit 00111010 arania. [Mr Reid would get rid of the inconsistency in
·C.’s account cf Th. by inserting et between eam and 1110111001 ‘that watcr was
the first principle, and that it (water) was God and the mind which pro-
duced all things out 01 water ’. One would be glad to relieve O. from the
>charge 01 talking nonsense, but it is a question here whether he would
object to put nonsense into the mouth 01 Vell, and it must be remembered
that we have the evidence 01 Minucius in favour 01 the existing reading]

di alludet According to the preceding sentence T. only attributed divinity
10 mind, and here wc have just the opposite supposition 01 deities with·
out mind: then we find a transitive verb without an object, and lastly
another supposition as to the possibility 01 mind existing apart from body,
this supposition standing alone as a protasis without an apodosis. If, set-
ting asida the grammatical difficulties, we endeavour tc establish a general
'connexion in thought with what preoedes, we have 10 consider whether the
>argument is direct, 01 ad taminare, whether carpasia used in its wider
sense (= matter), or its narrower (= animated body), lastly how we are to
understand the words deas and census. It will help to clear the ground 11
I first give Epicurus‘ own account 01 sensatico (Diog. L. 163) καὶ μὴν
