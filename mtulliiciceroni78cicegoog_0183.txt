pervading movement initiated by the Anaxagorean Nous, in contrast to
the innumerable disconnected movements of the Epicurean atoma Hirzel

lninflnlto z ‘in an infinite subject ’, a more general expression for the
preceding awos lastaria, not, as Hirzel, p. 94, with a distinct reference ιο
the universe considered apert from mind, though when the unintelligible
mena insolata had been changed into the abstract infinitum, it could not
fail to suggest ιο an Epicurean the thought of the infinite void as its only
legitimate interpretation To Anaxagoras the infinity of mind meant its
unlimited wisdom and power: here it is understood cf a mind not bounded
in space or inclosed in body, but the Epicureans recognized nc immaterial
existence except τὸ κενόν, which can neither effect nor be affected, but
merely makes movement possible tc bodies, ὥσθ’ ol λέγοντες ἀσώματον

translated by Kiihner ‘a sensation which the nature of the infinite
mind would experience without being itself moved by it ’‚ governing qao

governs pue by rediret: he proposes also to substitute apriles for epac.
The meaning the-n would be ‘a feeling with which it would feel without
its own nature being moved'. Heind inserts tota from the quotation in
August Ep. 118 and takes senam of the infinitus elle masaa meeth divinae
which penetratas all things, c qao sensa si pelleretur nature tota ίροα sewum
creperet. Hirzel p. 95 agrees with him in making epae celare pulsa Nom.

Nona oi these explanations seem tc me satisfactory: Sch and Ku give a
very harah construction, and the latter’s quo (sc. seara) palae makes aenan
the cause, not the result of impact Hira agrees with Sch. in retaining
the awkward construction qao (sema) metiret, and his explanation seems ιο
make the Epicureans attribute feeling ιο inanimata nature, a conception as
abhorrent ιο them as that oi a soul of the universa Heind giras a good
sense, ‘ii there were an all-pervading mind then every thing would be

it so obscurely. I think a clause is wanted to balance ire infinito, and
