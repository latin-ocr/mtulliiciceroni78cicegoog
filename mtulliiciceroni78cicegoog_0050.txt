there are clear allusione to Anaximenes (1) in p. 65, 10 Anaxagoras
(2) p. 66 (see nn. on the corresponding passages in the N. D.): there is

Considering the very fragmentary etate of the Philodemian trea-
tise from p. 65 10 7 5 (i. e. 1111 we resch Persaeus), it is remarkable
that more than half of Cicero's list should be found in it almost
1111110 same order² 3 that in both Aristippus should be omitted; lastly
that both should end with Diogenes, making no mention 01 his suc-
cessore Antipater and Panaetius, the latter 01 whom exeroised 0 far
greater influence over the Romans than any other Stoic³. It appears
strange however that Heraclitus and Prodicus are not included in
Cicero’e liet. Himel thinks thie is because Philodemus identifies the
teaohing of Persaeus with that 01 Prodicus p. 76, and the teaching of
Heraclitus with that 01 Chrysippus p. 81; 10 which Schwenke objects
that Philod. gives the doctrines 01 Prodicus and Heraclitus by them-
selves in the first instance, and only mentions their agreement with

¹ The names which appears only in one'list 010 printed in italice. Diels has
facilitated the comparison of Cicero and Philodemus by printing them in parallel
columne (Doaop. pp. 531-550).

³ Thieie especially remarkable in a writer like Philodemus, who, ae we know
from the anonymoue treatise published by comparati, Turin 1875, had touched
on these later Stoice in other writinge.
