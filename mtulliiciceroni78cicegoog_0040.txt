enthusiasm. The Academy on the other hand was endearcd ιο him
as being lincelly descended from Plato, for whose sublime idealism
and consummate beauty cl style he cherished an admiration little
short of idolatry‚ and aleo as being the least dogmatic os systema, and
the most helpful ιο the orator from the importance it attached ιο
the use of negative dialectic. But while (licere defended the
Academia doctrine cf Agnosticism in regard ιο speculative questions
os metaphysica, while he held it impossible to give any demonstrative
¹ procf either of the immortality of the soul or ol the existence of
God, he refused, bcth on the ground of sentiment and of policy to
extend his scepticism to practical questions of morality and religion.

He held in common with the Stoice that the universal instinct of '

mankind must be regarded as testifying to a universal truth ; and,
in common with Scaevola and the elder generation oi Roman states-
men‚ that it was the duty of a good citizen ιο accept the tenete ol the
national religion except in so far as they might be inconsistent with
the plain rules of morality. Thus the conclusion of his argument on
the nature cf the Gods may be considered to point the way, raguely
indeed and hesitatingly, tc the mysticism cf later times, when the

human mind wearied out with its fruitless search after truth‚ abjured
reason for saith, and surrendered itself blindly either to the traditione

ol priests or to the inward vision of the N ec-Platonists.
