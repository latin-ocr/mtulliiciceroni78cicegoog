οι deus: Mr Roby proposes ιο read ot (which might easily lose its
vowel aiter αοιιιοιο, and change into er) as it introduces a minor premiss in
a quasi-syllogistic argument. But where one syllogism is subordinated to
another (as in this passage cinus autem—rpitur represents the minor
prcmiss in the syllogism of which eine οἱνιιιια nullo οιοαιο is the major, and
rec beatus quidem the conclusion) it is not uncommon to omit the signs oi
opposition between the propositione oi the subordinate syllogism: thus,
A, none are happy without virtue; B, but virtue is active and your God
inactiva, therefore not virtuous; 0, therefore your god is not happy.

ne beatus quidem: ‘not happy either’ (wanting in happiness as well
as in virtue), ci. § 72 n.‚ and ξ 113.
