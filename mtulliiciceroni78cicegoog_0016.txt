as opposed to the Ionio systems, was that it found its ἀρχή, its
key of the universe, not in any known substance, but in number
and proportion This might naturally have occurred to one who
had listened to the teaching of Thales and Anaximander. After all
it makes no difference‚ he might say, what we take as our original
matter, it is the law of development, the measure of condensation
which determines the nature of each thing. N umber rules the har-
monies of music, the proportione of sculpture and architectura, the
movements of the heavenly bodies. It is Number which makes the
universe into a κόσμος, and is the secret of a virtnous and orderly
life. Then by a confusion similar to that which led Heraclitus to
identify the law of movement with Fire, the Pythagoreans went on to
identify number with substance. One, the Monad, evolved out of
itself Limit (order) and the Unlimited (freedom, expansiveness), the
Dyad3 out of the harmonicus mixture of these contraries all par-
ticular substances were produced. Again, One was the point, Two
the line, Three the plane, Four the concrete solid (hut from another
point of view, as being the first square number, equal into equal,
it was conceived to be J nstice). Yet once more, One was the central
fire, the hearth of the universe, the throne of Zeus, round which
revolved not only the heavenly bodies, but the earth itself. The
Decad is the ordered universe snrrounded by its fiery envelope.
The Pythagorean doctrine of the soul and of God is variously re
ported Zeller thinks that Oicero’s representation belongs to the later

teachers, and not to Pythagoras himself, as it is not supported by .

Plato and Aristotle. If we may trust the oldest accounts, there does
not seem to have been any close connexion between the religious and
philosophioal opinions of Pythagoras. We are told that he believed in
One God eternal, unchangeable, ruling and upholding all things, that
the soul 'was a ‘harmony,' that the body was its prison, in which it
was punished for past sin and disciplined for a divine life after
death, that those who failed to profit by this discipline would pass
into lower forms of life, or suffer severer penalties in Hades (N. D. 1
27, 74, 111 27, 88).

The second of the Italic schools was the Eleatic‚ founded by

Xenophanes of Colophon in Asia Minor (b. 569 ma), who migrated
to Elea in Italy about 540 ao, While the Pythagoreans strove to
explain nature mathematically and symbolically, the Eleatics in their
later developments did the same by their metaphysical abstractions.
Xenophanes himself seems to have received his first philosophical
