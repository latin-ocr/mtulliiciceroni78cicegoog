who was no doubt misled by the ambiguity of O.’s words in this passage)
agree that the Epicurean Gods were corporeal and compounded of atoms' ;
and he defends his interpretation by the use of ccrwretca in such passages ’
as 11 42, 101, Dio. 1 130. I do not think we ean argue from the use of the
Past Part. οοιιινοιιιι, which imphes the completion of the process, to the
verbal, implying the process itself; and besides, the reference is plainly to
the circadae ea· atomis of § 68, where it was shown that any such com-
pound must be liable to ι’νιιιιιιιιιι to avoid this danger Ep. had recourso

(with its consequences as above pointed out) '. The only concretio implied
in the Gods of ξ 49 was that of the images, involving superficial area but
not depth, cf. mqurammua 1159. The tanlquam scopata was probably
suggested by the Homeric ichor‚ N. v 340 ῥέε δ’ ἄμβροτον οἶμα θεοῖο, l ιχώρ,

si in ceris ungeretur. 1f the reading is correct, the sense audeon-
struction require that flag. should be taken metaphorically ‘if such a body
were fancied in the case of waxen figures': otherwise the literal sense
is suggested by fictilibus and cerat (used as in Juv. vm 19, where see
Mayor's m, and cerie flagerdzb oblectari Justin xxxvr 4). Iam inclined ιο
think however that the true reading is ιι 121 cnn[1s n1onn]nrue ‘if the
phrase were used in connexion with wax figures’, cf. dicemus in Venere Oea
just below. The repetition of cue explains the omission of the letters in
brackets, and the remaining letters would be taken for ai fingeretur, which
would be likely to maintain its ground against the true reading, even after

the insertion of loceris from another text Plin N. Η. xxxv ξ 4speaks of ’ ,
