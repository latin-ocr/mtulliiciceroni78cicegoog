and may probably be considered 16161 developments of Epicurean
doctrine.

There is still the first sectiou of 016616 16 consider, which has
nothing corresponding to it in the fragments of Philodemus. It is 6
preliminary criticism of the Platonis and Stoic theories 61 the origin
61 the world, turning chiefly on the difficulties involved in the idea
of creation at any given moment. The argument is similar to that .
contained in Lucr. v. 110-234‚and Plut. Pl. Phil. p. 881, but given
more fully than in either. We find no allusion to it in the following
sections 611116 N. D. To thiais joined an argument (repeated in
the later sections) against 6 mundane deity, as hiconsistent with the
divine attributes of rationality and blessedness Such a preliminary
criticism comcs naturally enough to prepare the way for the positive
statements 61 the Epicurean theology, as there was no body of
belief which could be upheld against the latter, except such as was
derived either from Plato or the Stoice. ¹
., When we try to determine the connexion between this and the
historical section which follows, there is much to suggest the con-
clusion 61 Krische (p. 23) and Hirzel, that the latter section was
inserted 66 611 afterthought. Thus in 5 36 we find ut jam od 6611166
Balbe 66616111, though the Stoice, whom Balbus represents, had been
already treated 61 111 the earlier section3 similarly in regard to
Plato (5 30 compared with 5 18); and the inconsistency is still more
manifest in 525, 1116116611 alio with most editors, reading 11666

on these passages). Itis further objected that there are no subse-
quent allusione to the historical section either by 06116 or Balbus ;
but 06116 does allude to it three times, 55 63, 91, 94, and, even 11 he
had not done so, there would be nothing surprising in it, since 016616,
as Schwencke remarks p. 56, 16 1161 likely to have had any Greek

pointed out; end there was no occasion for Balbus to recur to an
