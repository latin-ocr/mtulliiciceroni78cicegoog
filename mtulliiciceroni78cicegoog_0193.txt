charge. The passage alluded νο is vn 821, where ὁ adamica, speaking the
author's sentimenta, says ‘there is something very surprising incur notions
about astronomy, τ’ὸν μέγιστον θεὸν καὶ ὅλον τὸν κόσμον φομέν οὔτε ζητεῖν
δεῖν οὔτε πολυπραγμονεῖν τὰς ciriae ἐρευνῶντας· οὗ γὰρ οὐδ’ ὅσιον ebur, but
true piety requires just the opposite. We ought νο carry our inquiry into
the nature of the celestia] deities (the Sun, llloon, νο), ον least so far as to
enable us νο avoid snchblasphemy as men are guilty of, when they call ¹
thern wandering stars, and coniound the rates of their movements'. Itis
plain that the word φαμέν introduces, not a sentiment of Plato’s, but that
of the Athenian public, who had banished Anaxagoras and put Socrates to
death on a similar charge. Plato's own view comes out still more clearly
in bk ΧΠ 966, where he argues that astronomy rightly studied is the fonn-

dation oi true piety.

been misplaced in the uss, we may suppose that the present clause was
originally connected with the preceding, (jam ala Pramo-cenea) either by

a cam which has dropped cut between qm‘ and ia Tim. so as νο make idam

far as νο enable them to stand alone.

divinities owing their existence to the good pleasure of the one Father and
Creator. Sa we read (rim. 34) of the plan pursued by the everliving God
in forming the God who was νο νο (i. ο. the world), and in p. 92 this created
God is called the visible image oi the invisible God. The name οὐρανός is
sometimes used of the κόσμος, at other times confined νο ννο starry heavens
as opposed νο the earth. Beside the passages already quoted, showing the
divinity of the stars, see Tim. 40, where tha Demiurgus is said νο have
made the earth, our nurse, the guardian of day and night, the first and
oldest of the gods ὅσοι ἐντὸς οὐρανοῦ γεγόνασι. In the same passage Plato
affirma his belief in the deities of the traditional religion (eos qaae majoram

they, like the celestial deities, acted as subordinate agents in the creation
