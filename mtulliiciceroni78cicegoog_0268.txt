rubro mari Indiave: a sort of hendiadys for the ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα of the .

Greeks, which comprehended the Indian Ocean together with the RedSeaand
Persian Gulf. The allusion is probably tc the whales, of which Pliny says
(N. H. 1x 2) plemma et maimo im Iudico mari animalia, e quibua balaenae
quaternum jugerum, pristes ducenum cubitorum and further on, speaking
of (talare, rubri amru paeninsula impons, he says that liujus loci quiete ed
immobilem magnitudinem beluae adalmodem so Strabo xv 2 12 mentions
among the difficulties experienced by Nearchus, in his voyage from the
mouth of the Indus to the Euphrates, the shoals of enormous whales
(φυσητῆρον); he continues λέγουσι μὲν οὖν καὶ oi νῖν πλέοντες ris 'racem
μεγέθη θηρίων, ‘which are however frightened by shouting and the sound of
the trumpet'.

curiosissimi: used in a good sense os of Chrysippus, Pace. 1 108, m
omnm historio culmosos.

tam multa-quam sunt multa quae exsistunt: this somewhat verbose
expression is intended, I suppose, to give greater prominence to the idea of
multitude, ci Orci. 108 acceo orator tam malta empse, quam melsa scm
mostra For the substantival use tam matteis more common than tot,
which is so used however in eae. 66 tot amum superare possem.

negemus esse, quia numquam vidimus: cf Locke’s story of the
King of Siam, who refused to believe the Dutch Ambassador’s description
of the icc in Helland3 and the controversy on the velue of experience, as
opposed to testimony, between Hume, Campbell and others In Ep's
argument against the Stoice, who sre here speaking through the mouth of
Cotta (see Imroduction), the point debated is the velue of particular ex·
pericnce es opposed to general reasoning. ‘The universe ', said the Stoice,
‘exhibite the working of what we call reason (this is shown et length in
Bk 11), therefore it must be animated by a rational soul' ε ‘no ’, replies the
Epicurean, ‘experience shows that a rational soul can only exist in human
fbrm’ ; which the Stoic meets by a reference to the limited nature of our
experience, and the vasiness of the universe, pointing out the erroneous
conclusions which would necessarily llow from the assumption that there
can be nothing in the infinite unlmown but what is a repetition of the
infinitesimal known. Ἰ In point of fect the Epicureans did not themselves
adhere to this principle: their doctrines of atoms, of images, of the gods, of
the origin and growth of the world, were anything but matters of ordinary
experience (as Lactantius points out De Ira 10 quirillo mea umquam?
foll); nor did they care about their scientific truth, except in so iar as

ip] offered an escape from the acknowledgment of a divine government of
t euniverse.

us a syllogistIc proof of anthropomorphism’ ; see this in § 48.
nonvsetromore, sed dialecucorum Of.§ 70 n. Hirzel p. 177 foll. argues
that Zeno is here alluded to, and that there was an important section of the ’

Epicurean school, commencing with Apollodorus trancriptum, who scta
