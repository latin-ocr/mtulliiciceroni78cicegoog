5110, the approving mention, slightly veiled it is true under au
Academic form, 01 110 81010 doctrine of the divinity of the universe

595, and of the teleologioal argument 5100. Schwenke carries
the argument further than this. He notices certain marks which
indicate a more or less close following of his authority on the part
¹ of Cicero, such as the introduction of quotations from Latin authors,
allusions 10 Roman customs, to other writings of his own, dre. 3 and
in reference 10 1110 particular section, which professes to be a reply
to what bas gone before, he remarks that it is very uulikely that
0. could bave met with an independent treatise, whether Academic
or 81010, which should just meet and refuto the arguments in the
Epicurean treatise used by him for the earlier sections ; that pre
cise references therefore to the preceding argument are probably
additions by (1. ; and from this he draws the conclusion that the last
part 01 Ootta's speech, from 5 115 10 110 end, has undergone least
manipulation and most faithfully represents the original authority3
auditis precisely here that we find the largest amount 01 81010
matter. Again, noticiug the remarkable break after 5 105, where
Cicero after proposing 10 consider the question of the abode and
manner 01 life of the gods in 5 103, suddenly recurs 10 their nature,
leaving the previous question altogether unanswered, he suggests
that we have here a fragment of the original, which S. began 10
translate, but found 10 10 unsuited 10 110 purpose of meeting the
speech 01 Velleius and forgot afterwards 10 cancel Here again there
are marked indicatione of a 81010 origines Ι bave pointed out in
my notes on the bestiae quoe igne aurci patentur, and on naturae
cocornmodctum.

There are however some arguments which need consideration in
favour of the Academic origin of the section. Thus Hirzel bas
pointed out the close resemblance between parts of this and the
sceptical argument in Sext. Emp. rx, also the inconsistency between
Ootta's statement as to the superstition of Epicurus 5 85, and that
which is quoted from Posidonius in 5123 3 and lastly the anti-Stoic
sentimenta which ¹we find interspersed,ffe. g. the repeated profession
of agnosticism 557, 66, 84, 91, 94, 110 contempt for the consensus

gentium 5 62, 110 objection 1ο 110 rationalizing and allegorizing of
the mytbs 5 119. Schwenke replies with considerable force that

Sextus has himself borrowed from 0 81010 original in such passages
as lx 123 and 131, that we find the opposing views as to tbe
sincerity of Epicurus’ religious belief stated in Sext. Emp. 1x 58 aud
