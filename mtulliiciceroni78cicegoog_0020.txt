the constituent atoms, the mode of arrangement, and the larger or
smaller amount of vacuum separating the atoms. Thus Soul, the
divine clement pervading the world‚is a sort of fire made up of
small, round, smooth atoms in continual motion, and largely mixed
with vacuum. The account given by Democritus of the origin of
the existing universe ia that there were, to begin with, an infinite

number of atoms carried downwards by their own inherent gravity
at different rates in proportion to their magnitude, that thus they
impinged one upon another, and gave riae to all sorta of oblique and
contrary movcments, out of which was generated an all-absorbing
rotatory motion or vortere Under these various movements cor·
responding atoma found their fitting places and became entangled
and hooked together so as to form bodies. Thus the earthy and
watcry particles were drawn to the centro where they remained at
rest, while the airy and fiery rebounded from them and rose to the
circumference, forming a sort of shell between the organized world
and the infinitude of unorganized atoma on the outside. There was
an endless number of such worlds in various stages of growth or
decay under the influx or efflux of atoma ; the destruction of each
world followed upon its collision with another world.

The account given of the mind and its operatione was as
follows :-Particles of mind or soul were distributed throughout the
body, and were continually escaping owing to their subtle nature,
but, aa they escaped‚ their place was taken by other partiales inhaled
in the breath. When breathing ceased there was nothing to recruit
the living partiales, and death speedily followed. Every mental
impression was of the nature of touch, and was caused either by
actual contact with atoma as in the case of taste and hearing, or by
images thrown off from bodies external to us, and entcring in through
the poree.

These images were a lrind of film consisting of the surface atoms
which were continually floating off from all bodies without any
disturbance of their mutual order, and were, so to speak, a cample
of the object from' which they were detached Democritus also used
· the same word (εἴδωλα) for the anthropomorphic combinatione of the
finest seul-atoma which he believed to exist in the air, and to be
at times perceived by men. These were the Gods of the popular
religion, not immortal‚ though longer lived than men: some were
friendly, some malignant3 he prayed that hc might himself only meet
with the former. Of. N. D. 129 b 120.
