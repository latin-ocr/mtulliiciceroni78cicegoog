GREEK PHILOSOPHY. XV

phanomenal world. Parmenides must be right iu denying motion
and multiplicity, for their assertion leads to selfcontradiction Zeno
was in consequence called the inventor of Dialectic. His arguments,
especially the famous ‘Achilles' still find a placa in treatises on

Logia (N. D. 11182). ⁴

The clearly marked opposition between the Ionio and the Eleatio
views of nature, as shown in Heraclitus and Parmenides, had a
powerful influence on the subsequent course of philosophy. Em-
pedocles, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists agreed in accepting the
Eleatic principle ol the immutability of substance, while denying its
absolute Oneness 3 and they explained the Ionio ‘becoming’ aa the
result of the mixture ol a number of unchangeable substances.
Empedocles of Agrigentum (b.50013.o.) held that thare were four
etemal, seli—subsistent elements or ‘roots of things‚’ which were
being continually separated end combined under the influence of
Love and Hatred. At times Love has the upper hand, at timas
Hate. When Love has the complete supramacy the elementa ara
at rest, united in one all-including sphera (Σφαῖρος)τ when Hate
prevails, the elementa are entirely separate. The soul, like all other
things, is formed by the mixture of the elementa, and is thus capable
of perception, for like can only ba perceived by like. In his opinions
on the Gods aud on religion, Empedocles was chiefly influenced by
Pythagoras. He believed in the existence of Daemons inter-mediate
between Gods and men, some ol which had passed into mortal bodies

as an atonement for former sins, and could only be restored to their ⁴„

original state after long ages of discipline. While he speaks of
God at one time as one spirit pervading the world in swift
thought, in other places he speaks of Gods produced like men from
tha mixture of the elementa, but possessed of a longer existence, and
than again we find divinity attributed to Sphaerus and the four ele·
ments and two moving powers (N. D. 1 29).

Raturning now to Ionia, we see the effect of the Eleatio school in

the speculatione ol Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (b. 500 nc), of whom
Aristotle says that he appeared among tha older philosophers like
asober man among drunkards Instead ol the four elementa of
Empedocles, which he declared to be themselves compounds, he
assumed an indefinite number of ‘seeds' ol the different kinds oi
matter. To these seeds later philosophare gave the distinctiva name
