world. But while the former with the Ionic sensitivensss to all

¹ outward influences dwelt more upon the material clement itself and

the life which manifested itseli in its ever-changing developments,
the latter (who, if not themselves Dorian, were yet surroundcd by
Dorian settlers, with their Dorio ideal of discipline, order, stability,
superiority to sense, as opposed to the Ionio ideal of free growth, of
ease, beauty and natura) turned their thoughts more to the laws by
which the world was governed, or the one unchanging substance
which they believed to underlie its shilting phenomena.

The first name in Greek philosophy is the sccalled founderos
the Ionio or physical school, Thales of Miletus, a contemporary ol
Solon (ao. 640-550), said to be of Phenician descent. With him
begins the transition from the mythological to the scientific inter-
pretation of nature, the transition, as Grote puts it, from the question
Who sends rain, or thunder, or earthquskes, and why does hs send
itl to the question What are the antecedent conditions of rain,
thunder, or earthquakesl The old cosmogonies and theogonies

’ history of a number of supernatural beings variously related to
each other. The first parent of all, according to Homer, was
Oceanus (Il mv. 201, 240), perhaps a nature-myth to be inter·
preted of the sun rising and setting in the sea. Thales stripped
him of his personality, and laid down the proposition that water
is the one original substance out of which all things are pro
duced. Aristotls conjectures that he was led to this belief by
observing that moisture is essential to animal and vegetable life:
probably it was also from the fact that water supplies the most
obvious example of the transmutationes matter under its three
forms, solid, fiuid and gaseous Thales further held that the uni-
verse is a living creature ; whicb he expressed by saying that ‘all
things are full of cod: and in agreement with this he is reported to
have said that ‘the magnet had s souL’ It is this portiones his
doctrine which is travestied by the Epicurean critic in Bk. 1 ἓ 25.
The second of the Ionio philosophans was Anaximander, also an

inhabitant of Miletus (aa olo-540). He followed Thales in secking
for an original substance to which he gave the name of ἀρχή, but he

(i. a. not yet developed into any one of the forms familiar to us) and ἵ

Hesiod's primaeval Chaos, as Water did to the Homeric Oceanus
