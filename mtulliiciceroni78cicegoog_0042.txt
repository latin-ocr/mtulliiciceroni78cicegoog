Oa. Cotta commences hisreply withan expression of his belief
in the existence of the Gods, but holds it impossible to arrive at any
certainty with regard to the divine nature. xx1 bl-xxu 61.

Ob. Weakness of the argument derived from universal consent.
Negatively, such consent is unproved: positively, many have held a
contrary opinion. xxm 62-64.

Oc. The atomio doctrine is opposed to sciense. If it were true
it would be inconsistent with the belief in the immortality of the

Gods. When Epicurus, by way of evading the difficulty, speaks oi
quasicorporeal Gods, he becomes unintelligible. xx111 65—xxvn 75.

od. Weakness oi the argument in favour of anthropomorphism.
If the chs present themselves to our eyes in human form only,

that is because our ancestors‚ whether from superstition or policy,

established that belief among us3 elsewhere the case is different. If
that form seems to menthe most beautiful, that is merely the preju-
dice of racc. Jf it is said that experience shows rationality to be
confined to that form, on the same ground we might attribute all the
properties of man to the Gods3 but reason shows the danger of
arguing from our limited experience‚ and it shows also that a body
which is suitable for man is unsuitable for such a being as God is
supposed to be. xxvn 7 6—xxxv11 102.

Oe. Even if we grant that there are such images as Epicurus
describes, what ground have we ior thinking that there is any reality
corresponding to theml or, in any case, ior supposing that they
reveal to us a blessed and immortal heingi Immortality you think
proved by your doctrine of equilibrium, but the same doctrine would
prove the immortality'of men. And how can beings be happy who
are without activity and therefore without virtuel As to pleasures
of sense they are worse off than men. All that can be predicated of
them is absence oi pain, yet even this is impossible since they must
be in constant fear of dissolution from the influx and‘effiux oi atcms.
xxxvn 103-xc1 114.

G f The Epicurean principles, if accepted, are fatal to religion
What inducement is there to worship beings without activity and
without benevolenoe'l Epicurus' profession of piety was merely a

blind to deceive the multitude xm lle-mv 124.
