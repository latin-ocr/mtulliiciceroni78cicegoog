Euclides of Megara, the founder of the Megaric and so ultimately
of the Sceptic school, was chiefly attracted hy the negative teuching
of Socrates, and his followers are noted as the inventors of various
sophisms which served them as offensive weapons against their
opponente. The main positive doctrine attributed to them is that
they identified the Good, which Socrates called the highest object of
knowledge, with the Absolute One of Parmenides, denying the existence
of Evil.

Antisthenes (N. D. 1 32), the founder of the Oyni'c and indirectly
of thc Stoic school, was the caricaturc of the ascetic and unconven·
tional side of Socrates. Nothing is good but virtue, nothing evil but
vice. Virtus is wisdom, and thc wisc man is always perdectly happy
because heis seli-sufficient and has no wants, no ties and no weak-
nosses. The mass of men are fools and slaves, and the wiso man
is their appointed guido and physician. Acting on these principles
the Oynics were the mendicant Friars of their time, abstaining from
marriage and repudiating all civil claims while they professed them·
selves to be citizens of aworldwide community. On the subject ci
religion Antisthenes stated explicitly, what was doubtless implied in
the teaching of Socrates, that there was only one God, who is invisible
and whose worship consiste in a virtuose life.

Aristippus of Oyrene (N. D. 11177), the founder of the Syrenaic
school, resembled Antisthenes in dwelling exclusively upon the prac-
tical side of his master's teaching. He interpreted the somewhat
ambiguous language of Socrates about happiness in a purely cudae
monistic sense and declared· that the only rule of life was to enjoy
the present moment. Wisdom was essentia] to this, as it freed the
mind from prejudice and passion. It was the boast of Aristippus
no less than of Antisthenes ‘mihi rea, nou rue rehtu subjungere

coaor'. Among the more prominent members of this school were

Theodorus (N. D. 12, 63), surnamed the Atheist, who lived towards
the clossof the ith century, nc. He objected to the doctrine of his
predecessor on the ground that it did not leave sufficient scope to
wisdom, since pleasure and pain are so much dependent on outward

circumstances 3 and put iorward as the chief good nottho enjoyment
ol* passing pleasure, but the maintaining of a calm and cheerful frame
of mind Euhemerus, whose religione system is referred to by Oicero
(N. D. 1 119), was a pupil of his His contemporary, Hegesias, called
πεισιθάνατος from his gloomy doctrine, considered that as life has
more of pain than pleasure, the aim of the wisc man should bs not
