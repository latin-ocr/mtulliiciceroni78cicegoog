the year 1810 a volume of Herculaneasia, edited by Drummond and
Walpole, was publiahed in London. This contained an anonymous
fragment, twelve columns in length, entitled by the editors περὶ τῶν
θεῶν. The fragment excited considerable interest owing 10 the resem-
blances it presented to parts of the speech of Velleius in the first
book of the N. D, and it was ably reviewed in the Quarterly¹ and
Edinberylr during the course of the year. Hayter wrote a reply
to the former in· the same year, speaking of the book as Φαι8ρου περὶ
θεῶν. The same authorship had been already claimed for it by Miirr,
in a German translation of Philode-mes περὶ μουσικῆς (Berlin, 1806),
11 which he announced that among the forthcoming Herculanean
publicatione there was a treatise entitled Φαίδρου περὶ φύσεως θεῶν,
which had been made use of by Cicero 101 his own work on the
same subject. Hayter allows that the name Philodemus would
naturally suggest itself, but he says the space does not admit of
reading so many letters. Au improved text with notes was brought
out in 1833 by Petersen at Hamburg, under the title Phaedri
Epicurei, calpe anonymi Herculanensis, de Nature Deorum. He
uses the following arguments to show that Phaedrus must be the
author. Since Cicero’s chief instructors in the doctrines of Epicurus
were Zeno and Phaedrus, both of whom are prominently mentioned
in the N. D, it is natural to suppose that he must have horrowed
from one or the other. And as Phaedrus is spoken of in terma 01
warmer praise (see ᾖ 03) he seems the more likely of the two ; besides
Zeno (ἕ 94) is said to have attacked his own contemporaries, whereas
the latest writer criticized in the speech of Velleius is Diogenes 01
Babylon, who died not later than 150 ae. The strongest argument
however in favour of Phaedrus is, that in a letter to Atticus (111143),
written about the time of the composition of the N. D, 010010 asks

to have his treatises περὶ θεῶν 01 περὶ namatus* sent to him; just

asin x111 8 he asks for Panaetius περὶ προνοίας, which we know 10Ι
have been used by him in N. D. 11 118, 00010101 6, 12, 1188,

¹ See n. on §39 under Chrysippus.

² The older reading is Φαίδρου περισσῶν et Ἑλλάδος, which was supposed 10
1010110 two books of Dicaearchus, 0. having asked for other writings ol his in
earlier letters. It was suggested that the former treatise might be a criticism
of the Phaedram of Plato, which D. is known 10 have condemned 'as too ornate; '

while the latter was identified with the βίος Ἑλλάδος oi which some fragments
still romain. ,
