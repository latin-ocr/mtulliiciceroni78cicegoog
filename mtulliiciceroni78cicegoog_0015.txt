πάντων. Every particle of matter is in continual movement. All
things are in flux like the waters of a river. One thing alone is per·
manent, the universal law which reveals itself in this movement.
This is Zeus, the all-pervading reason of the world. Itis only the
illusion cf the senses which makes us fancy that there are such things
as permanent substances. Fire exhibita most clearly the incessant
movement and activity cf the world: confined in the body it con·
stitutes the human soul, in the universe at large it is God (the
substance and the process being thus identified).

Heraclitus is the first philosopher of whom we read that he
referred to the doctrines of other philosophers. He is said to have
spoken highly of some of the seven Wise Men, but condemned
severely Pythagoras and Xenophanes as well as the poets Hesiod,
Homer and Archilochus. Though I agree with Uebcrweg in classing
him with the older Ionics, yet his philosophy was no doubt largely
developed with a reference tc the rival schools of Italy.

In the N. D. allusion is twice made to the obscurity of

Heraclitus (1 74, 111 35), buthe does not appear in the catalogue of ’

philosophers criticized by Velleius, and this though Philodemus had
certainly treated of him, aa we may see from the allusione in'the
Fragments (Gompertz, pp. 70, 81). The reason for this omissionis
probably that, his philosophy having been incorporated into the Stoic
system, it was unnecessary to discuss it separately. See Hirzel‚
p. 7 foll, and N. D. 11135,1 74.

We must now cross the water with Pythagoras of Samos, born
582 aa, who settled at Crotona in Italy, 529 aa, aud there founded
what is known aa the Italic school He seems to have found in the
mysteries and in the Orphic hymns the starting point which Thales
had discovered in Homer 3 and there can be little doubt that his
doctrine and system were also in part suggested by his travels in
Egypt· He established a sort of religiono brotherhood with strict
rules and a severe initiation, insisted on training in gymnastics,
mathematica and music, and taught the doctrines of immortality and
of the transmigration of souls, and the duty cf abstaining from animal
foed. He is said to have committed nothing to writing himself,
but his doctrines were religiously guarded by his disciples (of. N. D.
1 10), and recorded by Archytas and Philolaus, the latter a con-
temporary of Socrates
