distinctly stated that that alone is eternal which has in itself the principle
oi sels-movement, ὅτι ode ἀπολεῖπον εὀοτό, while that which is movcd by
another (lile being regarded as a species oi movement) cesses ιο live when
it ceases to be moved, and is therefore in itsell mortal What is com-
pounded is especially liable to this lav, see rim. 41 ι τὸ δοθὲν πᾶν λιτόν,

μόνῳ προσήκει μὴ πάσχειν τοῦτο. How then does the universe being oom-
pounded and receiving its principle of movement from without, and there-
fore essentially mortal, escape dissolutioni Because the FirstMover and
Compounder eternally wills ιο keep it together as a living unity, and his
will is stronger than any band, rim. 320, 33 A, llas This Platonis
principle is ol course the only ground for the Christian belief in the oon-
tinuance of any created existence. Bp. Butler, it is true, in defending the
doctrine of Immortality against the Materialists (Aeol. ch. 1) makes use of
the argument from indiscerptibility; but this is only ιο show that, even
supposing the soul material, it need not necessarily perish in death, of
which the only known effect is to dissolve what is dissoluble: he is far
from maintaining, as some have done, that each individual soul possessos
an inherent immortality o potori, so as to render its extinction impossible
even to the Almighty. 'l’he argument here used by Velleius is taken from
Aristotle De Ocelo 1 10 where he maintains the eternity of the universe in
opposition to the Platonic doctrine of creation. [ol for the whole passage

any need to insert a second eadem, to be the object of requiro, as most ol
