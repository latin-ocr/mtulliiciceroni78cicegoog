which Pliny alludes N. H. 11 5 pentes uero quaedam animalia et aliqua

quorum-esset futurus: ‘dead rnen, whose worship, if they had been
raised to tho rank of Gods, must have borne exclusively the character of
mourning'. (if. Plut Ie. 70 p. 378 Ξενοφάνης η’ξίωσε τοῦς Αἰγυπτίους, εἷ
θεοὺς νομίζωσι, μὴ θρηνεῖν, εί δὲ θρηνοῦσι, θεοὺς μὴ νομίζειν (told with slight '
variations by Arist. Rau. 11 23) and the remarks in the Firet Ptilr‘ppic 13
on the Supplicatio to Caesar, an me cernetis decreturum fuissent parentalia
cum supplicationibus miscerentur? ut inexpiabiles reliqiones in rem publicam
indmerentur? adduci non possem ut quanquam mortuum conjunqerem
cum immortalium reliqione ; ut cujus repuleram nusquam earet, ubi paraue-
tur, ei prdlice supplicetur. The use of mourning garments at a supplicatio
was entirely forbidden, see Vatia. 30 foll. During the Feralia and Lemuria
the temples of the Gods were closed, Or. Fert. 11 563, v 491. The worship
of Zagreus, Adonis, and Osiris might fairly be described as a adtus in luctu.

ξ 39. Chrysippus: (Krische 443-481) called the second founder of the
Sloic school, εί μὴ γάρῆν Χρύσιππος, οῦκ ἂν ἦν στοά. His importance is marked
by the emphatic jam uero with which the sentence begins. Philodemus says

¹ This is the emendation suggested in the excellent article on the Hercu·
lanean Fragments which appeared in the Quartalp Remea, Feb. 1810. German
writers who have referred to this, have attributed it to Elmsley and others. Ι am
informed by tho present Editor of the Q. R. that it was really written by that

extraordinsry man, Dr Thomas Young, and indeed it is so stated by Dean
Peacock in his memoir.
