noou1 cu. xn §3st 119

ἀγαθαὶ πᾶσαν ἀρετήν, θεοῦς adrolo εἶναι φήσομεν, εἴτε ἐν σάμοσιν ε’νοῦσαι,
ζῷα ὄντα, κοσμοῦσι πάντα οῦρονόν, εἴτε ὅπῃ καὶ ὅπως.

ut Graeci dicunt ἄσιίμοτονε there seems no reason for doubting the -
genuineness of these words, as Heind and Ba have done; see n on physio-
lopicm § 20. There is a special reason for adding the Greek here, astho
Latin equivalents were not introduced till later, incorporale appear-ing
¹first in Seneca, incorporem in Gellius. The doctrine that all that is
corporeal is in its own nature mortal‚ γεννητὸν καὶ φθαρτόν, runs through
the whole of Plato (see § 20 n) and we find the unseen, which is eternal,
contrasted with things seen and temporal in Tine 28; but it is only the
Demiurgus who is essentially incorporeal; many of the inferior deities
are clothed in bodies.

iti-intellegi non potest: ‘a divine incorporeity is inconceivable', cf
§27 on Thales The absence of feeling involved absence of forethought and
absence of pleasure, see ξ 48. 0.’e own opinion is given Pasa 150, where
speaking of those qui nequeunt ριιαῑίς animale ait cacam corpore intellegeret
captatione comprelwndcre, he says quasivero intellegant prestab cit in ι’ρςο
corporc; and a little further certe et οἶονιιι ι’ριιιιη et dim'num colmam corpore
laboratam mpdotioce complecti volumus. Again ruso. 1 71 dubitare noa
possamus quin ailll sit calmis admixtum, cabil concrctam, ailad copulatam,
allel coayowntatum, sind duplex. Quod οιιιιι ita cit, certe nec secerni acc
dimili nec dlacerpi nec dbtralc' potest, ιιι interire quidem ipitar. Plato
argues against those who identified matter and existence, ταύτὸν σῶμα καὶ
otetur ὁριζόμενοι in the Sepla. 246 foll. where the term ἀσώματον occurs.

ξ 31 Xenophon: see Krische nor-234, Philodemus p. 71 ἒν τοῖς
Ξενοφῶντος ἀπομνημονεύμασιν οῦχ ὁρᾶσθαί φησιν τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν μορφὴνάλλά
τᾶργα. 'l'he passage referred to is quoted by Clem Al Prota ξ 71, Strom. v
ξ 109, and by others among the early Christian writers : it occurs in Mea
1v 3 ξ 13, where Socrates says that Euthydemus will soon be convinced
of the providentia] government of the world, if he is content to see the
Gods in their works without waiting to see them in bodily form, ἂν μὲν
μὴ ἀναμένῃς ἕως ἂν τάς μορφάς τῶν θεῶν itys, ἀλλ’ ἐξαρκῇ σοι τὰ ἔργα
adroic ὁρῶντα σε’βεσθιιι καὶ τιμᾶν τοῦς θεούς, a very different essertion from
that of the Epicurean critic here, who would identify this with the view
just before attributed to Plato (dcem ιιοιιιίιιαιῦ noa posse, οιιριιίιῦ rocca
debere). The next asscrtion et solem ct animam deum is founded upon
the same passage of the Memorabilia, where Socrates illustratos our
inability 1ο look upon God by the parallel cese of the sun, ὅ πᾶσι
φανερὸς δοκιῦν εἶναι ἥλιος οῦκ ε’πιτρίπει τοῖς ἀιθριάποις εἀντῦν ἀκριβῶς loir,
ἀλλ’ ε’ἀν τις αὐτὸν ἀναιδῶς ἐγχειρῇ θεᾶσθαι τὴν ὄψιν ἀφαιρεῖται, and of the
soul ἀνθρώπου γε ψυχή, ἢ εἴπερ τι καὶ ἀλλο τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων τοῦ θείου
μετέχει, ὅτι μέν βασιλεύει ἐν ἡμῖν φανερόν, ἀρᾶται δὲ ov’t' αὕτη. Il lS 1111118·
eessary 1ο say that in neither case does X. make the assertion attributed
to him in the text Thirdly it is stated that X„ speaks of God at one
time in the singular, at another time in the plural This no doubt is true,
