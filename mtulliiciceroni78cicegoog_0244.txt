' aoy. p. rasfolt, Hamilton 1 239. The Stoics, who prided themselves ou
their logical refinements and were especially distinguished by the name
dialectici, called it ἀξίωμα διεζευγμένον, thus explained by Diog. Ir. VII 72
διεζευγμένον ε’στὶνά ἀπὸ τοῦ “viror'' διαζευκτικοῦ συνδέσμου (‘ disjunctive eon-
junction ’) διέζευκται, οἷον ι’ἤτοι ἡμέρα ἐστίνῆ νθξ ε’στιν.” ἐπαγγελλεται att
σύνδεσμος οὗτος τὸ ἕτερον τῶν ἀξιωμάτων ψεῦδος εἶναι. F or etiam cf. Madv.

pertimuit tre—fleret necessarium The Stoice held that their prin·
ciple of Necessity was involved in the Disjunctive judgment applied to
future events, as may be seen argued at length in Far. 20 foll, eg. Since
it is absolutely necessary that a man now ‘living must at a given date in
the firture be either dead or alive, whichever of the two proves eventually
to be true must be now a necessary truth though unknown to us ; or, more
shortly, his existence or nonexistence at that date is a necessary truth;
which of the two it is, will be made apparent by the event Aristotle dia
cussed thepoint in his treatise De Imerpraatiorw ch 9 foll. ‘in regard to
the present or past, affirmative or negative judgments of existence are
necessarily true or false; but it is not so with regard to the future,
otherwise all future events would be fixed by necessity (dore εἶ ἐν ἅπαντι
χρόνῳ οὕτως εἶχεν ὥστε τὸ ἕτερον ἀληθεύεσθαι, ἀναγκαῖον ἦν τοῦτο γενέσθαι)
which is contrary to our own experience of deliberation and action' He
then solves the difficulty as follows, τὸ μὲν οάν εἶναι τὸ δν ὅταν ᾖ, καί τί μὴ
aaut tirmiter μὴ ᾖ, ἀνάγκη· od μὴν οὔτε τὸ δν ὅσον ἀνάγκη εἶναι, οὔτε τὸ μὴ
δν μὴ edouardi ἀπὶ τῆς ἀντιφάσεως άαάτὸε λόγος· εἶναι μὲν δ μὴ εἶναι ἀπαν
ἀνάγκη, καὶ ἔσεσθαί γε typri· ori με’ντοι διελόντα γε εἰπεῖν θάτερον ἀναγκαίαν (ie.
the necessity belongs to the compound judgment not to its parts taken
separately) ; λέγωδὲ οἷον ἀνάγκη μὲν ἔσεσθαι ναυμαχίαν αὔριον ἣ μὴ ἔσεσθαι,
ου’ μέντοι ἔσεσθαί γε αὔριον ναυμαχίαν ἀναγκαῖον ου’δὲ μὴ γενέσθαι. In the De
Fato 21, Ο. says that hs would rather accept the tsaching of Epicurus et

things happened by necessity, buthe cites Carneades to prove that no such
consequence as necessity is really involved in the Disjunctive J udgment

καί ori ξύλου καθημένην λίθῳ καί ori λίθῳ βαλάν διώλεσεν as contravening the

principle of contradiction.
