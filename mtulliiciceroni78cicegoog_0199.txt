nulla species divina: ‘no divine form' ie. no anthropomorphic God

quiex omnibus—deus: ‘whom he would have us believe 10 be a
single uncompounded God made up 01 all the fixcd 81118, 18 01 dissevered
limbs'. Zeller suspects an allusion in the original 10 the Orphic myth 01
Zagreus, which was interpreted by later philosophers 01 the 1111111101 maadi
pervading the universe (Plut. M. 389 Β). Simplex is an ironical substitu-
tion for 1011111111, 10 which it 18 opposed in 11134; cf. 118011 ll, where it
is opposed to 111111 alio jurleta atque 00111101. ¹The phrase mandi membre
occurs again § 100.

Heraclides: 1 native 01 Heraclea in Pontus, pupil of Plato and Speu-

, sippus and afterwards 01 Aristotle (Krische 324-336). In the letters to
Atticus there are many allusione to the Dialogues 01 Her. which were
distinguished 110111 those of Aristotle by the fact that in the former (as in
the N. D.) the author was made 1 κωφὸν πρόσωπον, while in the latter he
was the principal interlocutor (as in the Tusculana). C. speaks 01 him with
respect as cir 11011111 inprimis (Taso. 1. 8), aud quotes from him 1111146
and 130. The views here ascribed to him are common 10 the Platonic
school. We are further told that he held with Ecphantus, the Pythagorean,
that all material objects were eompounded of atoms, and that the apparent
movement 01 the heavens was caused by the rotation 01 the earth.

puerilibus fabulis: Plutarch (00111111. c. 11)(118111118 Her. 18 μυθώδη

he 18 said 10 have been ambitibus 01 being worshipped as a god after his
death, Diog. L. 190. ’

and Sch App. p. 263, who refers 10 Hand 11111. 111 649.

sensu—vult: a criticism interposed; ‘neither pure mind, nor gross
matter, such as the stars are composed 01, 18 separately capable 01 feeling ι
and to suppose that the moon and planeta with their changing phasea are
divine, is to deny the immutability 01 the divine nature ², ef. Plato Ecp. 11
