philosophica] amateurs 61 his time. As 16 the nature 611116 own
views, we shall be better able 1616116 6 judgment, if we look first at
the man and his position. Cicero was much more 61 6 modern Italian
than 61 an ancient Roman. A cerastem, sprung 116111 the Volscian
mauricipium 61 Arpinum, he had none 61 that proud, seli-centred
hardness and toughness 61 character which marked the Senator 61
Rome. Nature had gifted him with the sensitiva, idealistic tem·

, pemmoni 61 the artist and the orator, and this had been trained to

its highest pitch by the excellent education he had received. 1f he
had been less open to ideas, less many-sided, less sympathetie, less
conscientious, in a word, if he had been less human, he would have
been 6 worse man, he would have exercised a less potent influence
on the future 61 Western civilization, but he would have been a
stronger and more consistent pohtician, more respected no doubt by
the blood-and-iron school 61 his own day, as 616616. While hisimagina
tion pictured 16 him the glories 61 old Rome, and inflamed him with
the ambition 61 himself aetinga Roman part, as in the matter 61

toric greatness 61 Rome, yet he is never fully convinced in his own
mind, never satisfied either with himself or with the party or the
persons with whom he is most closely alhed. And this indecision 61
hispolitical views is reflected in his philosophy. Epicureanism indeed
he condemns, as heartily as he condemns Clodius or Antony: its
want 61 1116611661, 116 prosaie regard 161 matter 61 fact, or rather its
exclusive regard for the lower fact to the neglect 61 the higher, its
aversion to public life, above all perhaps its contempt 161 literature
as such, were odious in his eyes. But neither 16116 rival quite 16
his taste While attracted by the lofty 1666 61 116 166161 and re

had forgotten the more distinctiva portion 61 the teaching 61 116
founder, until his writings were re-editcd by Andronicus 61 Rhodes

must have been lecturing in Rome about the time 61 his consulship),
