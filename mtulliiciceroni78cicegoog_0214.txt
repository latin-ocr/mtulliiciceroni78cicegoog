good and powerful (lod. When Seneca says deos aomo 111111 1111111 (13an.
1v 19) it is not from any notion of the Gods being indifferent to the actions
ο1 men, but he is simply asserting the Platonic doctrine that (lod never
harma any (liep. 11 379 foll), that His acting is always for the best both to
the universe at large and to each individual in it. In Philod p. 94 we read
that it was charged against the Epicureans, that their doctrine deprived good
men of ‘their religlous hopes, πρασεπιφέρουσιν δὲ καὶ διότι τῶν ἀγαθῶν καὶ
δικαίων παραιρσάρεθα τὰς καλὰς ἐλπίδας ἃς ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς ἔχουσι, to which 11 is
replied p. 97 that the vulgar ideas ο1 reward and punishment are aban·
doned by all philosophare, and that many go so far as to deny them any
power to hurt, οὐδεὶς γὰρ ὥς εἰπεῖν τῶν ὠφελεῖν καὶ βλάπτειν εἶρηκάτων φιλο·
σάφων τοὺς θεούς, ὁμοίας τοῖς χυδαίοις (the vulgar) ὑπελιπεν τὰς ὠφελίας καὶ
τὰς βλάβας, πολλοὶ δ’ otti βλάπτειν ὅλως ἔφασαν αὐτούς, but the true and
just are rewarded as Polyaenus has stated in his let book: p. 100 ὠφελίας
ἐκ θεῶν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς καὶ βλάβος τοῖς κακοῖς καταλείπουσι (i.e. apparently the
Epicureans): p. 124 καὶ σωτηρίας άνθραίποις διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καταλειπτὲσν ὑπο·
γράφει (i.e. Epicurus) dai πλειόνων, ἐν δὲ τῷ τρισκαιδεκάτῳ περὶ τῆς οἰκειότη-
τος ἣν πρός τινας ά θεὸς ἔχει καὶτῆς ἀλλοτριότητος : p. 125 ‘with the favour
ol heaven (θεῶν ἵλεον ὄντων) we need 11011111· war, with 1111 favour of
heaven we shall pass our lives in purity': pp. 86-89 ‘the Stoics deny that
the Gods are the authors ο1 evil to men and thus take away all restraint on
iniquity and degrada men to the level of the brutes (for who would be
balked of the injustice for which he aravos, from the fear ο1 air or 11111111),
while we say that punishment comes to some from the Gods, and the
greatest of good 1ο others': also p. 145. Itis difficult to see how this
approach to the common opinion (which goes much beyond what Lucr.
allows 11 70) can be reconciled with other positive statements ο1 Epicurus
or with his general principles as given in the text. See the Academia,
or rather Stoic, criticism in§ 121. For the form ο1 expression (aec tatere
ι’ρειιιη nec actitare alten) we may compare St J ames 1 13 ὁ γαρ θεὸς ἄπει-
ραστάς ἐστι κακῶν, πειράζει δέ αι’τός οὐδένα, Plus. Mor. 1102 11 καὶ φαῦλον

proposition having no more reference to the past than to the present ε the
Imperi. is afterwards used in order to remind the reader that this is a
statement made in the past by Epic, not necessarily adopted by the writer ;
see Draeger § 131, aud (on the mixed construction) § 124 Bc, where itis
pointed out that when there are two subordinate clauses, standing in
different degrees oi subordination, the more remote subordination is 111-
quently expressed by the Imperi the less remote by the Prea Subj. (lom-
