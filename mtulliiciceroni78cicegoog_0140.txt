able, see Madv. Fto. 1 19, Roby Gr. ἐξ 1734, 1735. The ind which is
found in the very similar passage Diria. 1 7 crem omnibus ire rebec termi-
tae turpia eet, tom ia eo loco monime which concorns religion, is more
naturally used in comparing particular 00000 (‘as-so’ ‘both-and’); the
Subj. views the particular case in relation to the general principle, as in
Off. 1115 cem totoptr‘toeoptia fioyzyero eit, tom 001100 ferocior in eo aaa

there are many questions in philosophy which are far from having been
fully cleared up, there is one of special difficulty, I mean the inquiry into
the nature 01 the gods’. [⁴1 think that in nearly all the passages where
cem—tom is used by O. there is 0 contrast between 0 general statement
aud 0 particular case, whether the clause with com contains an Ind or a
Subj. 11 the cem clause introduces 0 fact viewed asa concession made
by the speaker, then the Subj. is necessary3 otherwise not ’. J. S. 17.]

nition of the soul's nature’. For construction cf. 198 od siparum quoe
