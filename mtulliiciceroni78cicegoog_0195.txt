not exclusively of X. but of the greater part of the Greek philosophors

p. 363 n it is made the sign to distingrush between the esoterio and exoteric,

moro scientific treatises, where they speak, now of the Suprema Deity
himself, now of the subordinate gods who are his agents. This distinction
appears in the same passage of' the Memorabilia, oi τε γὰρ ἄλλοι ἡμῖν

ch. xm ξ 32 Antisthenes. Krische 234-246. C. is here translating
from Philodemus p. 72 παρ’ Ἀντισθένει δ’ ἐν μὲν τῷ φυσικῷ λέγεται τό κατὰ
νόμον εἶναι πολλοὺς θεούς, κατὰ δὲ φύσιν ἕνα (compare Varro’s elassification
of theology as fabulosum, naturale, civile Aug. θ. D. VI 5). Before the
decipherment of this fragment, C.'s statement was unsupportcd by any
independent authority, but we have a saying of Ant. reported by Theodorei
(Graec. Aff. 1 14) which agrees very well with it, θεὸς ἀπὸ εἰκόνος orl γνωρί·
ζεται, ὀφθαλμοῖς οὔχ όρᾶται, οὐδενὶ ἔοικε· διόπερ αὐτόν οὐδεὶς εἰιμαθεῖν ἐξ
εἰκόνος δύναται.

Speusippus: of Krische 247-258. Spengel and Sauppe in their
editions of Philodemus find an allusion to Sp. in the lines just preceding
the account of Aristotle (Gomp. p. 72) but there is nothing there which
could illustrate the account here given, which is in fact unsupported by
any ancient authority. We know hardly anything of Sp. except that he
modihed the teaohing of his master in the Pythagorean direction. The
criticism here is as reokless as in the case of Antisthenes

y§ 33 Aristoteles: cf. Krische 259-311. The treatise here referred to
isnolongerertant. It is also cited by Philodemus p. 72, but unfortu-
nately the fragment gives no more than the words παρ’ Ἀριστοτέλει δ’ ἐν
τῷ τρίτῳ περὶ φιλοσοφίας. Diog. L. v 22 tells us it consisted of three
books3 see Zeller³ 111 p. 58, foll. who shows that Krische is wrong in
