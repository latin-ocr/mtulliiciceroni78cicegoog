ζετό war' τὸδὲ λοιπὸν ἄθροισμα παρασκεύασον τὴν αἰτίαν ταύτην μετείληφε
καί αὐτὸ τοιούτου συμπτώματος παρ’ ἐκείνης, οὗ μέντοι πάντων ὦν ἐκείνη
κέκτηται. διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς ψυχῆς οὐκ ἔχει τὴν αἴσθησιν· ori γὰρ αὐτὸ
ἐν ἑαυτῷ ταύτην ε’κέκτητο τὴν δύναμιν aab. from which it appears that the
fine atoms which form the soul and especially its purest part, the mind or
reason, which has its seat in the beart, (ic. 66) are the true source of
sensation, but that they can only act when confined within the body, on
leaving which they are immediately dissipated and no longer exist as souL
Body by itself, i. e. the eompound of grosser atoms known to us by the
name of body, is incapable of sensation, but when united with the finer
atoma of mind, it becomes sensitiva to a certain degree. On the general
subject of the relation of soul and body, cf Lucr. 111 esp. 230—287, where
he shows that either by itself is alike incapable of sensation. Taking this as
our clue, Ι think the only satisfactory way of getting over the difficulties of
the sentence is to suppose that the apodosis tc the ind protasis has been
lost. This was the view of Lambinus who inserted the clause europeam
auriti before aeiy‘anrit, changing et amate into awntera Most of the modern
editors have followed in the same track, The text which I have given is
that of Baiter except that I go with Lamb. in omitting et mate, which
seems to have arisen simply from a misreading of the abbreviated meae:
, when this was once taken as an Abl. it would naturally be joined with the
preceding rensc by an et. Sch’s reading runs the first question teo much
into the second; the first car must certainly be followed hyan oriy'amit:
and it is also easier to account for the loss of the ind clause, if its end was
an echo of the let. How then will the argument standi The dogma
attacked is, in its most general form, that the first principle is divinely
animated water 3 io which itis objected that we have here an unneoessary
combination of two principles: ‘if divinity is possible without feeling, why
add mindi Why may not simple water stand for the first principle? On
the other hand, if mind is capable of existing alone, unconnected with any
body, why tie it down to water i' It is difficult to deal with the argument
from the ambiguity in the use of the word ‘god'. If by ‘god’ ismcant the
first principle, then the Epicureans would have allowed that this may
exist siae masa. In their view senseless atoms are the first principles, and
they could have no α priori objection te senseless water holding the same
office. On the other hand, if the name ‘god' implies personality, then itis
plain that ¹the first principle of Thales was not a god Divine persons such
as those whom the popular religion recognized were as subordinate in his
philosophy as they were in that of Epicurus, but they are certainly not
more opposed to the former system than to the latter. The point of the
objection seems to be theta dynamical principle, like that of the older
Ionio philosophare, as opposed to the mechanica} principles of Democritus,
isan irrational blending of two contrary principles, the materialistic and
the idealistic. In this objection Plato and Aristotle would concur, both
holding that the universe took shape under the influence of eternal, self.
