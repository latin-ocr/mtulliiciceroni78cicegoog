'The elementary contraries, hot, cold, meist, dry, are separated from -
this first matter by virtue of the eterna] movement belonging to it,
thus are produced the four elementa, the earth was in the form of a
cylinder, sels-poised, in the centro of the universe3 round it was air,
and round that again a fiery sphera which was broken up so as to
form the heavenly bodies. As all substanees are produced out of the
Infinite so they are resolved into it, thus ‘atonin g for their injustice'
in arrogating to themselves a separate individua] existence. The
Infinite is divine, containing and directing all things: divine too are
the innumerable worlds which it is ever generating and reabsorbing

into its own bosom. (N. D. 1 25.)

After Anaximander comes Anaximenes also of Miletus, who is
supposed to have fiourished about 520 no. While his doctrine
approaches in many respects to that of Anaximander, he nevertheless
returned to the principle of Thales in so far that he assumed astho
ἀρχῆ, a definite substance, Aac, in contradistinction to the indefinite
ἄπειρον oi his immediate predecessor. Air is infinite in extent and
eternal in duration. It is in continual motion, and produces all
things out of itsell by condensation and rarefaction, passing through
successive stages from lire downwards to wind, cloud, water, earth
and stone. As man’s life is supported by breathiug, so the uni-
verse subsiste by the air which encompasses it. We are told that
Anaximenes gave the name of God both to his first principle
Air, and to certain of its products, probably the stars. (N. D. ’
126.)

The greatest of the PceSocratic philosophers, Heraclitus of
Ephesus, known among the ancients as the obscure and the weeping
philosopher, was a little junior to Anaximenes. Following in the
steps of his predecessor, he held that it wasone and the seli-
same substance which by processes of condensation and rarefaetion
changed itself into all the elementa known by us, but he preferred
to name this from its highest potency fure, rather than to stop at
the intermediate stage of cir. But the point of main interest with
him was not the original substance, but the process, the ever-
lasting movement upwards and downwards, fire (including air), water,
earth3 earth, water, fire. All death is birth into a new form, all
birth the death of the previous form. There is properly no existence
but only ‘becoming,' c'. c. a continual passing from one existence into
another. Each moment is the union of oppositos, being and not·
being: the life of the world is maintained by conflict, πόλεμος πατὴρ
