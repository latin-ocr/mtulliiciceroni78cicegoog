language 1111111111 its highest formal development in the period
which may be named after Quintilian, between Nero and Hadrian,
according to Brembach (Hatlfsbr'tcltleiuf Lat. Recltscltreibuup, p. vu),
between the death of Augustus and that of Trajan, according
to L Meyer (Ortleoprapluba Lutimc Summara’um p. 5). The latter
lays down the following rules for our modern spelling of Latin:
ua inaequalitate scribendi aut oculi offenderetur leqcutlauu aut e'u
errorem inclamantur culmi, scriptura uestra reddi oportet ad certae
usum ac morem aetatis, et quidam pecs, qua 111111 llupua scriptorum
pariter ingeniis et studiis grumumta‘corum ad summam est adducta
perfectionem ; andin p. 6, praeterea ut iu 1111111111, ita iu scriptura
tartaream scopulum confugere eportet quaeris inmetata.

Adopting these iulos, it will follow first, that we need not
trouble ourselves to framea conjectural text, such as Cicero might
have written, but should use the undoubted spelling of the latter
half of the first century A.1>.; and secondly, that where this spelling
itself was variable, as in the u ori of the superlative terminatione,
and the ι’ 01 1 of the accusative plural oi i-nouns, we should select
one mode and edhere stesdily to that. In making the selection

I should myself wish to apply to our own case the principle =

suggested by Meyer’s second rule, that, of two allowable spellings,
that should be preferred which is usitatius, least of a novelty to
ordinary English readers.

Tuming now to Miller’s text I find there several exemplos of
inconsistent, and some of unusual and, as Ι believe, incorrect spelling.
This is the more to be wondered at, because in his excellent review
of Baiter and Halm’s ed in the Jahrb. f. Ol. Pla'lol. for 1864,

vol. 89, P· 261 foll he condemns a similar inconsistenoy in them.

The following are the points in which the spelling in my edition
will be found to differ from that in Muller’s:

(l) I have always given the superlative termination in -imus;
Miiller at times has the form in umam. Thus we find facillume

5 9, but facillimeuu 5 61; turpissume 5 29, but turpissime 5 933 ,

simillumae 5 49, but simillimus 5 98; praestantissumus 5 47, but
praestantissimus 5 963 also levissumru 5 13, uafurumue 5 39.
