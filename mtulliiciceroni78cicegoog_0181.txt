cum praesertim: ‘as if formless air could be 1 God, whereas it is
fitting that God should be 01 the most perfect shape’. 01 1188 praesertim

as here the logical 101111 01 the preceding clause would be ‘es 11 110 could
possibly believe air to be 1 God'.

The criticism on the doctrine of Anaximenes, like theton Anaximander,
is nothing more than an assertion of its irreconcileability with the Epicurean
assumption 01 the eternity and human form of the Gods. In this O. copies
Philodemus, who charges the Stoics with denying the Gods whom all
worship and whom the Epicureans 111011, ἀνθρωποειδεῖς γὰρ cd νομίζουσιν,

Ι Oh. XI. Anaxagoras: see Krische 60-68, Hirzel 90-97. His freg-
ments are collected and explained by Schaubach and others. There is
little probability in the tradition (Diog. L. 11 6) which Ο. here follows, of
the connexion between Anaximenes and Anaxagoras The doctrines 01

the latter bear a much stronger resemblance to the Sicilian than to the
Ionio school

, primus 1011111 This is in accordance with the statements 01 Aristotle ’

and the best authorities, but is in fiat contradiction to the account 01
Thales given above. The doctrine alluded to is summed up in the words

ἐν τῇ φύσει τὸν αἴτιον τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τῆς τάξεως πόσης. Apparently O.
meant to paraphrase διεκόσμησε by the words discrepantem et modam
designari et cerasta, ‘the order and measure 01 111 things was marked out
ancl affected by the power and the wisdom 01 the infinite mind’. But
