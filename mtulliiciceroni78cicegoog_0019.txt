61 ‘homoeomeries,’ denoting that the constituent particles 61 bodies
were of the same nature as the bodies which they composed, while
the unqualitied 6161116 61 Democritus gave 1166 16 the different
qualities of their compounds by the modo in which they were
compounded. In 1116 beginning these seeds were huddled together
in a confused chaos, then came Nous, the pure selfmoving intel-
ligence, almighty and all-wisc (this takes the place 61 the half·
conscious Love and Hate of Empedocles), and communicated 6
rotatory impulse to the inert 111666, by means of which the cognate
particles were gradually brought together and reduced to order.
Nous is the soul of the world and dwells in all living things, even
plante, 66 the principle 61 their life. Whether Anaxagoras called it
by the name of God is doubtful Plato and Aristotle complain that,
having begun well, he failed to make full use of the right principle
with which he started, and turned his attention to mechanical causes,
only having recourse to Nous as 611666 66 machina when the others
failed. (N. D. 1 26.)

Diogenes of Apollonia in Orete was 6 younger contemporary 61
Anaxagorae, against whom 116 took up 6 reactionary position and
defended the older Ionio doctrine, assuming Ab 16 be the 6116
principle ont 61 which all things were produced, and assigning to it
611 the attributes of Nous. Both he and Anaxagoras taught 61
Athens, but were compelled to leave it on a charge of impiety. (N.
D. 129.)

theory, which was originated by his elder contemporary and friend,
Leucippus the Eleatic (N. D. 1 66). Briefly stated, their doctrineis
that of Anaxagoras, minus Nous and the qualitative diversity in the
seeds or atoms. They adopted the Eleatio view so 161 as relates
to the eternal sameness 61 Being, applying this 16 the indivisible,
unchangeable atoms, but they denied its unity,'oontinuity and im-
mobility, and they asserted that ‘Not-heing' (the Vocuum 61 their
system) existed 116 1666 than ‘Being,' and was no 1666 6666111161 as 611
