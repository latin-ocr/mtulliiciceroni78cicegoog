immediate sensuous impression produced on the mind when its line atoms
are struck by the cognate atoms which constitute the divine imagines,
atoms which pass unperceived through the coarser sieve of the bodily
senses, but also to the conception of blessedness and immortality to which
the mind attains by reflecting upon the impressione it has received. It is
the latter process which is properly expressed by cogitatio.

nee nuditate-appellat. At first sight it seems natural to take eol. as
an abl. of cause after cernatur ,· and so Sch. explains it by a reference to ¹
the distinction between the imagines thrown off from solid bodies (the στε·
ρέμνιο), which imagines are described in Diog. L. x 46 as ἇπὸρῤοιοι τὴν ἑξῆς .
θέσιν καὶ τάξιν διατηροῦσαι, ἥνπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς στερεμνίοις εἶχον, and a finer
class of imagines which reveal to us the shadowy form of the Gods The
expression would not be quite accurate, for even the finest images must in
the end consist of atoms (since all that existsis summed up under atoms
and void, according to Epic.) and solidans is essential to atoms of every
, kind3 still in popular language (prastaam e'ta daem) it might be said
that the images perceived by the bodily senses were perceived in virtue
of a massiveness which was not shared by the images which were per-
ceptible by the mind alone. The objections to this interpretation are
(l) that it really adds nothing to what has been already said in the
previous clause, though apparently contrasted with it by the word paetum,
(2) that it is difficult tc connect it with what follows, (3) that it is incon-
sistent with the words of §105 nec erae ia ea (speeie) allam soliditatem,
aeque eoadem ael aenariam perinanere, in which the absence of solidatas is
predicated of the divine form itself, not of the image, as distinguished from
the form, in virtue of which negative property the image is perceived iu a
particular way. Accordingly Peter (Gomneentatio cle N. D. Saarbriicken 1861)
and Hirzel tare soleditate qaaalam as a predicative Abl. of quality, of which
the former cites several exx. (N. D. 1 12 ceris falsa aaly'aacta tanta similite·

Itis vocabatis erae deos sacimas, 107 imaginatae forma, Liv. xm 62 in agro
Amiterno madtia locet homiaem specie procel eandm ceste ethos aee eam
allo eottgreaaoa, where there is the same accumulation of ablatives as here)
and further illustratos by the following parallel ia somnia milti oblata est
imago ἰιοοὶι, at oon acala red merite servaretur, caepae ingesti eorporis mag·
stadiae eaeqae derasajaba, eedferoeitate maloram ιρίειισῖσνο prodita. Taking
soliditate thus as referring to the substance of the deity which has aiiii
concreti, attic solidi in it (ξ 75), it is opposed to the previous clause which
referred to the mode in which that substance was perceived It cannot be
denied that there is something very harsh in the construction of such an
Abl. with cernatur, andI think it possible that ait may have been lost after
numeram before at. The term στερέμνιον occurs repeatedly in the frag-
ments of Epic. περὶ φύσεως and in his Epistle to Herodotus preserved in
Diog. L. x.

We come now to the more difficult ad numerum, which must evidently
