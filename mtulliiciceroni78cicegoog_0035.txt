ἄγου δέ μὀἶ Ζεῦ, καὶ οὗ γ’ ἡ Πετρωμένη,
ὅποι ποθ’ ὑμῖν elul διατεταγμένος·

ὡς ἕψομαι γ’ ἄοκνος· ἦν δὲ μὴ θέλω,

κακὸς γενομένας, οὐδὲν ἦττον ἕψομαι.

From this it follows that the summum beaumis to live according
to nature and it is through virtue or wisdom that we are enabled to
dothis One who thus lives is αὐταρκής, in need of nothing. External
good, external evil are matters of indifference3 they only provide the
field in which virtue is to exercise itself. Pleasure is a natural
concomitant of activity, but is not a natural end: not even if we
count as pleasure that high delight which belongs to virtuons activity,
for pleasure regarded in itself has a tendency to lead man away from
the true end, viz. acting not for sels, but for the whole Man’s reason
being a part of the reason of the universe reveals to him the divine
law. As the emotions are liable to confuse or to disobey reason, it
is the part of the wisc, ie. of the virtuous, man to uproot them¹
altogether. Wisdom is not only speculative, judging what is iu
accordance with nature or the divine law, but praelicat, strongly
willing what is thus determined to be right. We may distinguish
different virtues in thought, but in lact no virtue can exist apart.
He who has a right judgment and right intention is perfectly
virtuous, he who is without right judgmcnt and intention is per·
feotly vicious. There is no mean. The wise man is perfectly happy,
the fool perfectly miserable: all the actions of the former are wisc
and good 3 all the actions of the latter foolish and bad. There may

. be a progress towards wisdom, but, until tlie actual moment of con·

version, even those who are advancing (ol προκόπτοντες) must still be
classed among the fools. Thus we have the strange union of a highly
ideal ethios with a materialistic philosophy. But it was impossible
to maintain this uncompromising idealism in practice. The later
Stolos found themselves compelled to admit that apart from virtue
and vice, the absolute good and evil, there were preferenoes to be
made among things indifferent, from which it followed that besides
perfectly virtuous actions (κατορθώματα) there was a subordinate class
of appropriate actions (καθήκοντα). In the same way, since they were
compelled to allow that their petlectly wise man, whom they vaunted
to be oqual to Zeus, had never existed, they found it necessary to
allow a positive value to προκοπή, progress towards wisdom, and to
sels-control, as contrasted with absolute apathy.
⁵ One other characteristic doctrine of the Stoics may be mentioned
