brevi tempore: O.'s purely philosophical works all belong 10 the
interval between the death of his daughter Tullia, Feb. 45 ac, and the
end of 44 rac. Teuffel arranges them chronologically as follows: de corr·
1010110000, Hortensius, ds finibus, Academica, Tusculanos despicationes, ri»
moeros, de aalma (10ον0100, 0010,ἀο divinatione, dc solo, laelius, ds glorio,
ole officiis, olc 0160111011. Ι1 must further be remembered that Cssser's
death occurred about the time of the publication of the present work,
March, 44 nc, and that O. was much occupied with politice from that
time until his death, at the age of 65, on Dec. 7, 43 rac.
