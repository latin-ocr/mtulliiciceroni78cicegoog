Euhemerus: fl. 300 rac, sent on an exploring expedition to the Red
Sea by Cassander, the results ο1 which he professed to recount in his
‘Sacrcd Records' (ἱερὰ ἀναγραφή). 111 this 113 gave a long account of an
island named Panchaia, lying towards the south, in which there was a

the same tendency may be seen in Hecataeus and Herodotus, and much
