a profession of the higher educati0n‚ and some cf them amaseed con-
siderable fortunae by their lectnree on rhetoric, the art oi speaking,
which was also made to include instruction in regard to political
and social life. The speculative interest of the older philosophere
was in them changed into a predominantly practical interest, lsi, as
to how to acquire wealth and notoriety for themselves, and nuely,
as a means to this, to attract by omniscient protensione, by brilliant
declamation and startling paradox, elever and ambitione young
men of the richer classes3 and then to secure their continued
discipleship by carelirl training with a view to the attainment ol

,s Protagoras orasses (so. 490-415)and(torriasof1eontini in
Sicily (nc. rso-375) are the earliest of the socalled Sophiste
Protagoras taught in Sicily and at Athens, from which latter place
he was baniehed on a charge of impiety in consequence of hie treatiee ,
on Theology referred to by Cicero, N. D. 129& 63. His treatise
on Truth began with the famous sentence, ‘Man isthe measure of
all things ς’ meaning that trnth is relative, not absolute, that what
each man holds to be true, that is truc to him 3 and similarly in
regard to conduct, that it is impossible to pronounce universally
that one kind of conduct is right, another wrong: right and wrong
depend upon opinion3 what is generally thought right is right
generally ; what each thinks right is right for him, just as each
man’e sensatione are true for him, though perhaps not for another;
there is therefore no more reason for one general assertion than
for another, perhaps an opposite assertion It ie plain that this
was a sort of conciliation theory naturally springing from the
fact of the oppositiones philosophical schoole: ‘each of yon are
equally right relatively, equally wrong absolutely 3 there ie no need
lor quarreL' Protagoras aleo wrote on Grammar and Philology.
Gorgiae is said to have first come to Athens in nc 427, and
afterwards to have travelled about giving lectures from town to town.
He devoted himself mainly to the cultivation of rhetoric, but also
wrote atrcatise περὶ φύσεως, in which he maintained lst ‘that nothing
exists’ (ic. donbtlese ‘in the absolute Eleatic eenee'); 2nd that if
anything did exist, still it could not be known, ard that even if
it could be known, the knowledge of it could not be communicated

‘ The general lecturas of the Sophistio period are photographed in the
clouds of Aristophanes, and in Thucydides’ chaptcrs on the Plagae ol Athene
and the Corcyram revolution, and his speeches generally.
