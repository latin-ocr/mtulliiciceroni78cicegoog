Dr Whewcll (Socordific Ideao 11 48-63) while allowing the velue of the
molocular hypothesis as an instrument of discovery, points out many diffi-
culties which stand in the way of our accepting it ‘ as a philosophical truth
’ respecting the constitution of the universe’ ; ci also Veitch Lueretius oud

As to the existence of omullus the results of modern science are thus stated, -
‘the undulatory theory of light supposes the whole of the celestial spaces to
be filled with the luminiferous ether. The astronomical argument therefore
in favour of absolute vacuum has fallen ; but the views of the constitution
of matter which heve grown with the rise of the molecular sciences of
chemistry, light, heat, electricity, dic, have supplied its place with much
more effect. The inference to which the modern philosophy would give
the greatest probability is thet all space is occupied by particles of matter
with vacuous interstices, showing all degrees of density'. Euqiut Cyclo·
