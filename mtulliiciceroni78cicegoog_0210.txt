Their religious system was the Zoroastrian dualism of the Iranian con-
queriug raca, modified to suit the subject Turanian population The
serpent God of the latter was identified with Ahriman, who was then
raised to an equality with Ormuzd, both being viewed as emanatione from
the absolute first principle, Ζ1111111-Α111111, ie. eternity. In course of
,time the Magian religion incorporated many polytheistic elementa, as
the worship of the Plancis, of Mithres, andos Mylitta, also known as
the Phrygian mother of the Gods. The religion of the Persians was pure

Zoroastrianism and, as such, opposed to Magianism, as is shown in the
overthrow of the Magi by Darius Hystaspes ς but it was confounded with

the latter b'y Herodotus and other writers. See Lenormant Manent of
Anatent Η111111, tr. 11 21-473 Rawlinson's Herodotus 1 Essay 5, on the

interpreting dreams, Dio. 146, 47. His younger contemporary Strabo (xv
