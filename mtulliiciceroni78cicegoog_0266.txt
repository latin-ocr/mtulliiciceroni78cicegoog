θάρσος ἀγαθῶν παρόντων, μήτε τινὰ δυστυχοΐσιν ἀποστροφὴν πρὸς τὸ θεῖον
ἀπολείπεσθαι. ’
8ηά1ἓ1216 compilant: for the robbing of 6616616666 111 83 and above §5 63

credo: ironical ¹

religionis: it seems better to take this as an objectiva Gen. like 6166666
666 sacrilegious do not fear the 6611666666 templi any more than robbers
fear death, cf Firc. 1 64 quoted above. 116ῑὶ616666, 666 reading of most mss ,
dsefended by Klotz (Adra ore. 11 11), would be rather awkward after the
mg.

§ 67. cum ipso Epicuro loquar: see § 61 6.

16 deorum numero ponere: for 66666 sce § 2911. Nacwro is Walker’s
corr. for 666666 of uss [written aa in U and therefore easily confounded

with 60. J. S. RJ.

numquam vidi—figura: sac § 48 and § 76.

6111111 solis-vidisti? 0. has made a mess of his argument Ep. says
‘I do not believe in the existence of reason apert from human ehape, for
I have no experience of it '. The answer is ‘You have never seen any thing
like the sun and stars moving in regular order, therefore you must disbclieve
their existence'. Of course 666 cases are entirely unlike: in the latter case
666 sensee, which (acc. to Ep.) always tall truth, essert the existence of the
sun ; in the former they aseert nothing, and we have tc procced by general
reasoning from analogy. What O. was really aiming 66 may be gothered
from 666 remarkable treatise of Philodemus, περὶ σημείων καὶ σημειώσεων,
where we find it stated (p. 37 Gomp.) that ‘the opponente of Epic, in
arguing that there may be unique existences in the unsecn world, are

employing the Epicurean argument from analogy', and (in p. 19) that ·

‘Epicuream allow that ἥλιος ric ἔστιν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ nol σελήνη καὶ πλῆθος
ἄλλων ὑπάρχον 66666666 (6 g. the magnet as contrastod with other atomos),
but they hold that when certain properties have been found constantly
united, where one existe theother will exist, μηδένας aversanae. The
anti-Epicurean argument therefore must evidently have been of thie
nature, ‘thero may be rational beinge without human shape, though our
experience presentsno parallel, for many things in our experience are un-
paralleled‚ and, on this principle, would have been incredible prior to
experience'.

onmoue ouantium: so Milton speaks of ‘five other wandering fires',
via Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Satura, see N. D. 11 § 52 foll

fining his motion within the limita of the ecliptic at either solstice' (lit. ‘by
666 two extreme points of one circle')‚ cf 11 49, 50, 101 foll
