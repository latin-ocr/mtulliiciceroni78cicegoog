Though the contrary principle hellam did not play so important a part in
P.'s system as in that of Empedocles, yet it may easily have been introduced
in the description of the mingling of Light and Darkness, Male and Female,
01 which the following lines are preserved to us (R. dr Ρ. § 151, Mullaoh
Fray. 1 p. 127) ἐν δὲ μέσῳ τούτων δαίμων ἢ πάντα κυβερνᾷ( πάντη γὰρ
στσγεροῐο τόκου καὶ μίξιος ἁρχὴ i πέμπουσ’ ἄρρενι θῆλυ μιγῆναι, ἐναντία
δ’ αὖθις Ι ἄρσεν θηλυτὲρη). Α fragment of Philodemus probably refers 10
this part 01 Ρ.’0 doctrine, estha name Παρμενείδης occurs just before (p.
65), τόν τε πρῶτον θεὸν ἄψυχον ποιεῖν, τούς τε γεννωμένους ὑπὸ τούτου τὰ
μὲν 011τᾶ τοῖς πάθεσιν τοῖς περὶ ἀνθρώπους. From 11118110 may explain
the Epicurean polemio in the text: ‘if P. deified human passione our
experience shows that these are liable 10 be affected by discsse, sleep,
old age, &c'.

elementa, deified under the names of Ζεύς 01 Ἥφαιστος (1110), Ἥρη (air),
Νῆστις (water), nitereris (earth) E. treats as divine the active principles
Νεῖκος and Φιλότης (also called Ἀφροδίτη), the all-including Sphere Σφαῖρος

gods and daemone 01 the popular religion, the souls 01 good men. The
criticism is equally careless.
