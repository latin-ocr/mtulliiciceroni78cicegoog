though this reading is supported by ull the uss, yet most of the later
editors have followed Rigalt and Davies in substituting emtam for modum,
in order to suit the following ‘motem musei junctum In confirmation of
thie emendation they quote Arist Phys. vm 1, φησὶν Ἀ. ὁμοῦ πάντων

word formerly written demptio should be written dum. whenever it
implies distribution or arrangement, as in Seleu. 69 where it is equivalent
to the διατόσσιιν of Xenophon
. in uuo—sentiret. Epicurean objection: ‘activity and feeling, i. e.
rational life, cannot have its seat in what is infinite, nor is feeling possible
without impact'. This is again an appeal to the Epicurean assumption,
that rationalityis only possible in a being of humen form, The νοῦς of

Philodemus p. 66, where we read that ‘mind was, and is, end will be
hereaftcr’, and that ‘it rules and governs all things and superintendo their
infinite combinations'. Though it is doubtful whether An. himself ex-
pressly deified Nous, later writers were certainly justified in regarding it
as divine (Sext. Emp. Mutia 1x 6, uio. Ae. lc.) as is practically done by
Vell. here. On the other hand he is said to heve been banished from
Athens for impiety in esserting that the sun was a rod-hot stone (Schen-
bach Areae. frag. pp. 38-52,139-142),since as Plutarch says (Pericles 23)
they could not endure the substitution of irrational causes and blind forces
in place of the old divinities
