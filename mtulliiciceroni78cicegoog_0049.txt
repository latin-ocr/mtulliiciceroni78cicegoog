. the Oxford Herculaneorio, vol. 1 p. w, the words Ζήνωνος σχολῶν
ooour in the mutilated title of the Philodemian treatise numbered
1389. This isos importance in regard to the question whether the
resemblanoes between Cicero and Philodemus are to bc explained by ‘

, direct copying on the part of the former, or whether both writers

may not have* borrowed from Zeno.

iproceed now to point ont what is the nature of these resem-
blances‚ and I think it will be seen that they cannot be simply sot
asido by such remarks as Soho'mann's (Introd. p. 18) ‘'ahnliohe
Angaben und Urtheile, wie dort, kamen ohne allen Zweifel in gar

Ἴ manchen anderen epikureischen Schriften ebenfalls vor.’ General

arguments no doubt might be a part of the common Epicurean tradi-
tion, but it is most improbable that this should be the case with
regard to minute points of criticism and to particular citatione
from the writings of opponents, some oi them misinterpreted‚ and
likely therefore to have been exposed by hostile criticism, if they
were in common use. Such references are those to Xenophon's Ἀπο-

’ - μμμμμμεθμμμμ (rna. p. 71, u. n 31) μ ro ne ομμμός of Antisthenes

(Phil. p. 72, Ν. D. 32), in support of a proposition of which we have ι
no information srom other sources3 tc the 3rd book of Aristotle’s
περὶ φιλοσοφίας (Phil. p. 723 N. D. 33); to Chrysippus περὶ θεῶν
bk 1 (Phil. p. 77, N. l). 41), treating of the Staio theology in general,
bk 11 (Phil. p. 80, N. l). 41) containing his explanation of the mytho
logy of Orpheus, Musaeus, Homer and Hesiod; to the περὶ τῆς

Ἀθηνᾶς of Diogenes of Babylon (Phil. p. 82, N. l). ll).

Assuming then, as we may, that there is an undoubted connexion
between the two treatises, the next point is to determine its nature and
extent. If wo compare them broadly together, we find the Epicurean
argument in the lst book of the N. D. made up of three parts, (l)

a preliminary polemio against the Platonic and Stoio views of the
origin of the world and the nature of God (ἕξ 18-24); (2) a critical
review of earlier philosophers from Thales to Diogenes of Babylon,
followed by a brief notice of the popular mythology in Graece
and elsewhere (33 25-43) ,· (3) an exposition of the Epicurean theo-
logy. Similarly the Philodemian treatise, as we have it, is nrade up
of three parts (l)a criticism of the popular mythology (pp. 5-61);
(2) a criticism of older philosophers (pp. 65-89); (3) an exposition
cf the Epicurean theology (pp. 93-151). The resemblanees notioed

’ above belong to the second, or historical section, which we will

now examine more closely. (licero’s list of philosophers is as fol-
