Phaedrae, cf. Grote's Plato Vol 111011. 36 p. 282 foll Ambrose objecting
from the Christian side, says (Her. 1 3) ‘the Creator had 110 need cf art

illae qunque formae: Plato represents the Demiurgus as educing the
four elementa out of the primaeval chaos (01010οί0 prima ὕλη, χώρα, τὸ
δεχόμενον) by stamping upon it certain geometrical forms, the combinaticn
of which gave rise to the five regular solids. The material particles which
received the-form 01 the cate constituted earth, those which were in the

Scholia to Arist. Plrye. p. 427 Brandis. It is strange that none of the editors
before Sch. saw the right meaning of the present passage. The reference to
the five solide is unmistakable by any readcr 01 the Timaeus, if it is 01100

Davies however seems 10 have been thinking more 01 the latter part 01 the
sentence where the uss have apte cadentes od animam efficiendum, and
purzled himself to find five constituents of mind (Plato rim. 35 a having
mentioned only three—the indivisible eseence of ideas ταύτόν, the divisible
essence· 01 bodies θάτερον, the mixture 01 both), instead 01 constituents 01
