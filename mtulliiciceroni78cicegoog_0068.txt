(6) In regard to nouns benewad hcm the Greek Ι bava followed
Madvig's rulo (Gram5 533 obs. 3), ‘Where both forms ara in usa, it
is better to adhare to 555 Latin', ιιι accordanca with tha principles
laid down by Quintilian 1 5 5 63 and Cicero Att. vt 9, (saa tha
quota10ns in Roby5471,4aa).rhus1 have always used tha
termination em for the Ace. of Greek ncuns in es, whereas Miiller
writes, at cna tima, Socraten (1 93), Timocraten (193), Simoniden
(160)‚Nansiphanen (1 93), Cleanthen (ιιι 5), but more generally
Socratem (131), Timocratem (1113), Simonidem (Dir.156),llmpe-
doclen, Aristotelem, Ganymedem, Archimedem, Euphratem, Xenc
phantom hc. So Ι have written ihim, Apim in 182, where Miller
has Apim but ibin: Ihava uniformly written Zeno, but in 5 70 Miller
gives Zenon.

. (7) Ι have always written di in tha N om. and dis in tha Ahl. 3
· Miillar usas di ordei, dis or deis indiscriminataly.

(8) I have written cheo in 5 72 where Miller has hpcio, but in
Dio. ι, 8 and 22 55 givos tha spellings Lyceum, Myceo. Whara ha
writes oportune 5 15, opomnnitas 5 92¹, benivolentia 5 58, Xerses
5 115, Aspia 5 82, Ι have written with Baiter opportune, opportunitas,
benevolentia, Xerses, Arpina In ona instance, inacho, Ihavc pre
ierrad tha lass usual spelling to 555 ordinary inchoo (which Mdller
keeps) not merely on tha ground 5555 15 has most authority in its
ι favour, but because it is tha more rational, as showing better tha
etymology and probably 5155 555 pronunciation.

Thus far I have not departad much from the prevalent usage
in tha latest editions. I have now to plead guilty to two heresias.
Tha first 15 5555 Ihave used the character J ior the consonante] Ι.
My reasons for doing 55 ara as follows: (1) theuso of J, to dis-
tinguisb the consonant from 555 vowel I, seems 55 me 5ο stand on
555 sama footing with the uso of V to distinguisb 555 consonant
from the vowel U. N either usa was known 55 555 ancients, but
convenience has lad most editors 55 preserve 555 distinctiva V,
indeed Madvig, who had dropped it in his first edition of the
De Finibus, returned to it in the later editions 3 and 511 who write
on the phonetics of Iatin are compellad to mend 555 unscicntifio
orthography of the Romans by treating the J and V as distinct
letters known by distinctiva characters. (2) 15 might perhaps bc
