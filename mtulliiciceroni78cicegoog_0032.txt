they thought that even he had approached too near to dogmatism
in saying that he Iurew that he knew nothing. Probable opinion

Getta in the 3rd book oi the N. D. is mainly derived from Clito
machus, the literary exponent oi the wiews of his master Carneades,
who is said to have never written anything himselfi The New
Academy commences with Philo (N. D. 159, 113), a pupil of Clite
machus and one of Cicero’s teachers. In it we see a return to
dogmatism combined with an eclectic tendency which shewed itseli
most strongly in Philo's pupil Antiochus (N. D. 1 6,16), who en·
deavoured to reform the Academy by uniting Stoic and Peripatetic
doctrines with the original Platonism. Gicero studied under him
aud used some of his writings for the De Finitus. Brutus, to whom
the N. D. is addressed, wasone of the most distinguished adherents
ol this stoiciaed Academy.

We turn now to the two most important developments of post»
Aristotelian philosophy, Stoicism and Epicureanism. To understand
them it is necessary to look for a moment at the changes which had
been brought about hythe conquests of Alexander. While Greece
proper lost its national life, the Greek language and Greek civiliza-
tion spread throughout the world, and the Greeks in their turn
became familiarized with Oriental thought and religion. Thus the
two main supports of the authoritative tradition by which practical
life had hitherto been regulated, the law of the State and the old
religiones Greece, were shaken from their foundations. The ueed
which was most strongly felt by the best minds was to find some

· substitute for these, some principle of conduct which should enable
a man to retain his sels-respect under the rule of brute force to
which all were subject. It must be something which would enable
him to stand alone, to defy the oppressor, to risa superior to cir-

Ncumstances Such a principle the Stoics boasted to have found.
Zeno (N. D. 1 36 at), the founder of the school, was a native of
(litium iu Cyprus. He carne to Athens about 320 nc. and attended
the lectures oi Grates the Gynic and afterwards of Stilpo the Mega-
rian and of some of the Academias, and began to teach in the στοά
ποικίλη about 308 Bo. He was succeeded by oteanues of Assos in
Asis Minor about 260 no. (N. D. 1 37, 11 13, 24, 40, 11163). Among
his other pupils were Aristo of Ghius (N. D. 137), Herillus of
