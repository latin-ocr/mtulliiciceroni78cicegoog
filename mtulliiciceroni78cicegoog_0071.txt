slightingly of the value 61 these readings: ‘Dliena’ varias lectiones
signifieat, qnae 66 ns qaedam vir doctas editioni Roberti Stephani
an 6111111111 adierit, Iste codsa, qnantum judicare datar, non
magnam praese tnlit vetustatem. Ι1 will be seen that Davies 11616

employs the Sing. Cadere, as 116 6166 does in the list of uss used by
him 161 1116 Academica I, 66. 1725 (collationem trs saetam in en-
entplasri editionis Stephanicae) while for Academica II he mentions ou
1116 same page varias lectiones ea dnobus rrss excerptas et adlitas orae
editionis 6661661666- Ῡ61 again, after having stated in the Preface
161116 161 ed. 61 1116 Tusculana 1708, that Bp. Moore had lent him
his Stephanus eant dnobus optimis 1666 6611616111, he adds in 1116 21111
ed 1723 laos Dliensern pansam aa 6666661666 nominavi: iis nanc
66666611 ab eadent mana tertias in pergamena scriptus, and cites all
three together in his notes 66 Dienses tres, 6. g. on nisi haereret 1 §aa
From this it would appear that the collatioris 61 the' two codices were
in the same handwriting, and that Davies, 61161 he had brought 6111
his lsi ed, discovered in Bp. Moore’s Library a complete text of the
Tusculans copied 661 by 1116 writer 61 the collatione. No mention is
made 61 these 1166 in the Preface to either 61 1116 editions 61 1116
De Divinatione and De Fato 1721 and 1730, 1161 have I come across
any reference 16 1116111 111 1116 notes to the De Divinatione, but Cori. Di.
appears frequently in the notes 16 1116 De Fato.

Bentley’s Life and Letters furnish some additional information
611 1116 earlier history 61 the Codices. In J uly 1692 Bentley, writing
1ο Graevius, who was then engaged on a new edition 61 1116 Cicera,
informs 1116111161Μ6616, 6111161 time Bishop of Norwich, 16 pre-
pared 1ο sene him 666661 arnas n annetiennes 666166,
qaas 66 vetusto 1661166 descripserat qnidam in ora ed. lna Stephani in
foi. Graevius, in his reply (Sept. 1692), accepts with thinks the
Bishop's offer, but says that he must finish 1116 orations before he can
proceed 16 1116 Philosophical works. In J an. 1693 Bentley writes
again 16 say that the Bishop will send the volume itself, and remarks
in reference to the value of the readings quantivis esse pretii re ipsa
comperies. Graevius, vrit-ing in 1116 following December, 66111166-

lauder. Frequent 6116616116 16 1116 book appear in the subsequent
correspondence‚ but Graevius is still 166 busy 16 melre 666 6111, until
st last the Bishop becomes impatient, and Bentley writes in Aug.
