lastly all but one appear ιο have scamium for inscientiam. Wyttenbach
followed by Heindorf and Oreuaer omits the clause id cst priaapiom
philosophiae, which is usually explained by a reference to Arist Met. 1
2 10 διὰτὸ φεύγειν τὴν ὅγνοιαν ἐφιλοσόφησαν, ‘the great discrepancy of
opinions is an evidence that the cause or starting-point of philosophy
was the painful consciousness of ignorance, and that the Academics
are justified in refusing to make any affirmation on points where certainty
is unattainable’. (See Krische p. 7.) Βαι this explanation is unsatis-
factory on several grounds; (1) there is no reason for making any refer-
ence to the origin of philosophy, (2) the present discrepancy of opinions is
no argument as to what may have been the origin of philosophy, (3) the
origin of philosophy is in no way connected with the Academio principle
(itself the result of a long history of philosophy) that man must be content
with probability, (4) bare ignorance is very far from being the cause of
philosophy, and it would be an altogether wrong use of words to make
imcicatio=rt φεύγειν τὴν ἄγνοιαν, (5) principium philosophandi would have
been a more appropriate expression for the supposed sense. Nor is it much
more satisfactory to interpret the clause as affirming that the Socratic
confession of ignoranoe is the starting-point of philosophy in the individual
(cf Ac. 1 44). If we retain the ordinary reading, I think itis best ιο take it
as giving the sceptical view, ‘the cause and origin of this whole windbag of
philosophy is ignorance'‚ of. Sext Emp. Mutia 1x 29 τὸ πολύτροπον τῆς
ἀποφάσεων (παρὰ τοῖς δογματικαῖς φιλοσόφοις) τὴν ἀγνωσίαν τοῦ παντὸς
chadeis ἐπισφρογίζεποι. Βαι though such language may have been used
by Hortensius and others (Fiw. 1 2), it is hardly conceivable that O. should
have adopted itas his own I should prefer therefore to follow Ursinus
<if one only knew what his us. wael) or Heind, whose reading gives an
excellent sense though somewhat clumsily expressed: ‘the discrepancy of
opinions proves that they all sprang from ignorance, and that the Ace
demics are right in refusing to make any positive assertion '. The interpo-
lation of the clause omitted by him would be easily aocormted for by the
supposition that id principiam philosophiae was a gloss on the words
Academicos αιοιιιιιοιιοιιι οοΙιιιιιιιιο, meaning that this was the leading prin·
ciple of their philosophy. The variety of opinions was the loth of the
