sions to the remainder 01 11ιο speech 01 Velleius are very scanty
(11 47 0οᾰ 73). 00 the whole I think the framework of the book
requires some such review of previous philosophers to justify the
frequent references to the diversity 01 0010100 00 the subject of theo

represented by the disputante The repetitions complained 01 000
scarcely to be called repetitions, for they leave ont the main point
in the previous argument against Plato and the Stoice, viz. the ques

be explained hy the haste and carelessness which characterize the
whole treatise, and 01 which we shall 000 1001οη000 10 the latter hali

There is 000 other point which is likely to striks the reader, and
which calls 100 0 few remarks, and that is the inferiority 01 11001110-

torical section 10 the othertwo. ln the lst section there is the usual Ι

themselves of interest and importnnce ; and 0000 regards the argu·

besides misreprescntation and abusa Is this a mark 01 0 different

What then is the general conclusion to which we are led by this
comparison 01 the two treatisesl The impression 1011 upon my
own mind is that as far as the historica} section extends cer-
tainly, and possibly 100 the expository section also, both have copied ’
0 common original, most likely Zeno, the toacher 01 both Philodemus
and (11000ος whom Cotta calls the spokesman (0000010000) 01 the
