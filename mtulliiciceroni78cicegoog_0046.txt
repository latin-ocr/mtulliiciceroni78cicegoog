tained in the first book 01110 N. D. Iwill begin with giving a

short account 01 1110 11001100, proceeding then 10 point out the more
striking resemblances between it and the present work, and will
finally examine more in detail the relations 01 110 two to each other.

In the year 1752 great curiosity was excited by the discovery 01
0 library at Herculaneum in the house which hasbeen called 01101

Piso the father-in-law 01 (1000011, 110111 110 1001 1101 ‘its site agrees
*with Oieero’s statement that the residence 01 110 Pisos was visible

from his own villa at Puteoli' (Hayter’s Report on 110 Herculaneum
MSS, Loudon 1811, p. 31); and also from the fact that most 01 110
uss found there contained treatises by writers belonging 10110
Epicurean school, 01 which Piso was an adherent, and that many 01
110111 1010 110 1101110 01 Philodemus, who is known (from Oiccro's
speech in Pisonem) 10 have been the intimate friend and instructor
of Piso. The difficulty 01 unrolling 110 0101101 papyri was very
great, and it was not till the year 1793 1101 110 101 Vol. 01
Ηο10010000010 (containing the 1100110001 Philodemus περὶ μουσικῆς)
appeared 01 Naples. At the instigationes 110 English Ambassador,
Sir W. Hamilton, the Princo 01 Wales undertook 10 supply the
necessary 101110 101 carrying on the work more actively, aad 0100

sent his librarian, the Rev. John Hayter, to assist in opening aud ,

copying the uss 3 111Ι which he succeeded 00 well that, in the four
years 110111 1802 10 1801, 111010 than 200 were unrolled. In the
101101 year the work had to he abandoned in consequence 01 110
French occupation 01 1100100, but copies 01 94 uss, after remaining
1010 while 01 Palermo, were ultimately seut 10 England and pre-
sented 10 110 Bodleian together with four unopened papyri²3 and in

ι(101110010111, in his paper La Vr'lla di Pisone r'n Ercoluno, 11001879,
maintains 1101 two 01 110 busts 100111 11010 represent Piso and his colleague
'Gabinium 0111 certainly they agree remarkably well with Cicero’s description 01
the pair in his speech Pro Sext. 18.

⁹ Among 110 unpublished sacainriles 01 011011 there is one 01 considerable
interest 10 studente 01 110 N .D. It appears as No. 26 in the catalogue 01 Her-
0010110011 rolls given in the Preiace 10 110 011011 Herculanarum Vola, 1824, 0111
10 11010 0111111011 Φιλοδήμου περὶ θείων. Through 1110 kindness 01 the Sublibrarian
111 Bywater‚ I have been enabled 10 examine this, and find that the real title is
περὶ θεῶν, the title-page consisting 01 1001 longitudinal strips which have been
wrongly posted together, so 00 to make 0 portion 01 0 broken letter look like an r
following θε. There are several peges which 010 fairly legible‚ but I did not in
1110 short timo 01 my disposal discover anything which would serve 10 illustrate
the Epicurean argument in Cicero.
