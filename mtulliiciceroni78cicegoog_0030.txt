existence in his own mind of the ideal form which is subsequently
impressed upon the stone ; (2) the existence of the stone; (3) the
process of carving3 (4) the motive which induced the sculptor to
make the statue, as for instance the desire to do honour to the
God whose statue it is. But the opposition of form and matter
is not confined to such simple cases-it covers the whole range of
existence from the Fir-st Matter‚ which is mere potentiality of being
at the one extreme, to the First Form which is pure immaterial
actuality‚ the Divino Being, at the other extreme. The intermediate
links in the chain are matter or form according as they are viewcd
from above or below, as marble for instance is form in reference to
stone generally, matter in reference to statue ; vitality is form in
reference to the living body, matter in reference to rationality. God
the First Form, is also the First Mover, the cause of the upward
striviug of the universe, of the development of each thing from the
potential into the uctna13 aud this not by any act of creation, for
He remains ever unmoved in His own eternity, but hythe natural
tendency which all things have towards Him as the absolutely Good,
the object and end of all affort, of all desire. The universe itself
is eternal, a perfect sphere, the circumference of which is composed
of the purest element, ether, and is carried round in circular motion
by the immediate influence of the Deity. In it arethe fixed stars,
themselves divine. The lower planetary spheres have a less perfect
movement and are under the guidance of subordinate divinities.
Furthest removed from the First Mover comes the earth which is
fixed in the centre, and composed of the four inferior elementa.
Still it exhibite a constant progressive movement from inorganic
into organis, from plant into animal, from life which is nutritive
and sensitive only into life which is locomotive and finally rational
in man. 'she human soul is a microcosm nniting in itself all the
faculties of the lower orders of animated existence, and possessing Α
besides, the divine and immortal faculty of reason. As each thing
attains its end by fulfilling the work for which it is designed by
nature, so man achi'eves happiness by the unobstructed exorciso of
his special endowment, a rational and virtuous activity. Pleasure
is the natural accompaniment of such an activity. Virtus, which
may be described as perfected nature, belongs potentially to man’s
nature, but it becomes actual by the repetition of acts in accordance
with reason. It is subdivided into intellectual and moral, according
as it is a habit of the purely rational part cf the soul, or as it is
