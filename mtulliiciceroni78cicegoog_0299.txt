trorum oros. Lobeck denies that there was any difference between the
Samothracian and Lemnian mysteries¹. The latter are only mentioned
here and in another passage from the Philoctetes of Attius quoted by
Varro L. L. 111 11 Lemaire praesto Ι litora raro, et 11111 Cabirum Ι delubra

which are celebrated at Lemnos in nightly procession, deep shrouded in
their leafy covert' (1111111111 saepibus 1111111 sort of hypallage for 11111111

quibus explicatis-deorum. Compare 111 63 on the allegorizing of
the Stoica The mysteries themselves appear to have been a kind of
miracle play illustrative of the story of Demeter and of other deities,
such as Zagreus‚ who were in later times associated with her. It is doubtful
whether the symbolical action was accompanied by any authorized inter·
pretation, but philosophers and moralists sought to explain the mysteries
in such a manner as to recommend their own views. While the ordinary
spectator, satisfied with tha splendid and impressive soenes which passed
before his eyes, carried away with him no distinct ideas beyond the
suggestion oi a future life of happiness which was in storo for the
initiated, the Stoice (as Dbllinger says, p. 198) regarded them as symboliz-
ing the tmth that the gods were merelya portion of the material universe3
the Peripatetics as showing that God had laid the foundation of civilization
in agriculture3 the Euhemerists that the objecta of worship were only
deified men; the Pythagoream aud New Platonists that the secret of all
religione was contained in the ancient theology of Egypt and the East
Plutarch expressly says that he who would rightly understand and profit by
the mysteries must take with him λόγον ἐκ φιλοσοφίας μυσταγωγόν (Ia c. 68).
For exx. of the ‘physioal interpretation’ here referred to by Ο. cf.
Lobeck lc. p. 136 foll, who quotes Themistius Or. 29 for the view of
Prodicus that the mysteries only referred to the operatione of agriculture3
