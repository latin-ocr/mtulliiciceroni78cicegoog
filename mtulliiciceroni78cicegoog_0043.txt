INTRODUOTION.

ξ {t DRAMATIS PERSONAE.

The Dialogus is represented as taking place on occasion 01 the
Feriee Latinae at the house of'O. Aurelius Cotta The year 01 its
supposed occurrence has to be determined from the following data
supplied by the Dialogus. Cotta and Cicero are both residing at
home ; the former is Pontifex but not consul, the latter, in spite of
his youth,is treated as an authority in philosophica] questions, and
allusion is made to his Athenian experience, which is however as-

signed to Cotta. The facts of Cotta's life may be briefly summed
up. He was born 124 sc. and like his brothers Marcus and Lucius

(who so warmly espoused the cause of Ο. against Oatiline and
Clodius) took an active part in the politics 01 his time. He be·
longed ‘to that wisc and far-seeing party in the Senate, which a-imed
at checking the corrupt and oppressive rule of the jury-courts of
equites, and at breaking the power 01 the city rubble by giving the
franchise to the Italian yeomen’ (Willrins De Oratore p. 5). After
the murder of their leader Drusus in 91 Β. c. (N. D. 111 80), Cotta
with many others 01 the party was driven into exile under the law
01 Q. Varius (N. D. 111 81), by which all who had encouraged the
insurrectiou of the Italian allies were declared guilty of treason. He
remaincd in exile throughout the Social War, and only returned
home when order had been restored by Sulla in 82sa Shcrtly
afterwards he became a member of the college of pontefices and in the
year 75 aa was elected consul. During his year 01 office he re
storcd to the tribunes some 01 the privileges which Sulla had taken
from them. On ceasing to be consul he was appointed to the⁴ pro·
vince 01 Gallia, where he gained some unimportant successes fer
which a triumph was decreed to him, buthe died of the effects 01 an
old wound before he was able to enjoy it. He appears in company
with P. Sulpicius Rufus as one 01 the younger interlocutors in 'the
De Oratore ,⁰ and his quiet persuasive style of reasoning is contrasted
with the passionate energy of the latter in the Brataa 5 201 1011.
In the 3rd book of the Dc Oratore Cotta is said to have devoted
himself to the study of the Academia system of philosophy as spart
01 the training 01 an orator, in consequence of a speech 01 Crassus
there recorded, see ἓ 145 aamqaaea conquiescam ente qaam illoram
