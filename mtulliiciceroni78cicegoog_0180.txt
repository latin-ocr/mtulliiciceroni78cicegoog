that A considered this to be τὸ θεῖον and to govern (κυβερνᾶν) all things.

tine (0.0. 11111) 10 justified in eaying that neither A. nor 'l'heles were
theists in the proper sense. It seems however that later writers gave a
more mechanical aspect to the physical theory of Anaximander, which
they regarded as differing from that of Anaxagoras only in the fact that
the latter recognized νοῦς where the former had seen only 0111111101 κίνησις,
cf. Ritter and Preller ξ 18 foll. with the notes from the Aristotelian com·
mentators. So Plutarch (Plac. Phil. 1 3, 4) finds fault with Anaximander,
but not with Thales, for making no mention of an efficient cause.
