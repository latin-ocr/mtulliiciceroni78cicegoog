any error on the part of Ο. as though he ascribed to Epic. the doctrine of
‘innato ideas' in the sense in which Locke (certainly not Plato, ior with
him the idea was latent till developed by μαιευτικῆ; nor Descartes, see
Huxley's Hume p. 83) understood the term. All that is implied is that
our religious ideas are not arbitrarily imposed irem without, but grow
up within as a natural and necessary result of experience. We must
understand innatam in the same sense in 11 12, cf. Sch Opmc. 1v 345, who
remarks that a primtpio innasci is the phrase used (1134) of what is
strictly inborn ·

de qno autem-confitendum est. [The argument is obscured by the
ordinary punctuation. Putting a comma after totamm we get the follow-
ing syllogism ι We all have from nature an idea of Gods: what all men's
nature agrees about is true: erqo we must admit the existence of Gods. R.]

omnium natura=omoes matare, cf. n on ξ 36.

hanc igitur habemus: resumes fateamur tatere. For the resumptive
use of igitar after parenthesis and for the change from Inf. to Ind. cf

attributes. ⁴

quod beatum—essent omnia: quoted from the κυρίαν δόξαν, an epitome

siste in the absence of trouble, whether experienced in oneself or inflicted
upon another ; therefore the (lods neither feel nor cause trouble, hence
the motive of anger, which might lead to their inflictiori of trouble, and the ..
motive of favour, which might lead to their taking trouble for others, are
alike manifestations of weakness, and inconsistent with our idea of the
Divino majesty. The answer to which is that (1) the word ‘trouble’ is
unmeaning in reference to our idea of God: if we suppose him to be
almighty, thought and action are as easy to him as breathing to us:
(2) while it is true thet passion and caprice are marks of weakness and, as
such, inconsistent with our idea of (iod, yet a righteous government, re-
warding virtue and punishing vice, is a natural corollary to thc belief in a
