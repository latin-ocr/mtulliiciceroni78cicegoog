impulse in the revulsion from the popular mythology. He con·
demned anthropomorphism and polytheism altogether, and said that
Homer and Hesiod had attributed to the Gods conduct which would
have been disgracesul in men. cod is one, all eye, afl ear, all
understanding 3 he is for ever unmoved, unchangeable, a vast all·
embraoing sphere. See N. D. 1 28. It is disputed whether the
last expression is to bo taken literally, implying that the universe
is God, or whether it isa metaphor to express God’s perfectiou and
omnipresence. The chief representative of the Eleatio School is
Parmenides (b. 515 aa). He disengaged the doctrine of Xenophanes
from its theologica] form, and ascribed to Being what his predecessor
had ascribed to God His philosophy is the antithesis of that of
Heraclitus. While Heraclitus said all is motion and change, the
appearance of fixity is merely illusion of the senses3 Parmenides
asserted, with distinct reference to him, that all that exists has
existed and will exist the same for ever, that it is change and
multiplicity which is illusory. Itis only by thought we can become
conscious of the really existent 3 being and thought are the same,
senso can only give rise to uncertain opinion In such language
we see partly a protest against the vagueness of the conception of
development or ‘becoming,' by which the Ionio philosophers en·
deavoured to explain the origin of things, ‘You say fire becomes
water, but each thing is what it is, and can never be otherwise 3'
partly an idea of the indestructibility of matter, partly an antici-
pation of the later distinction between necessary and contingent
truth 3 thus one point dwelt upon by him was the impossibility of
any separation of parts of space.

But though truth only belonged to the world of real existence,
Parmenides condescended to give his romanoe of nature for the
benefit of those who could not penetrate beyond the world of phe·
nomena He begins with two principles, light and darkness, also
called fire and earth, or male and female 3 and supposes all things
to proceed from their mixture. The existing universe consists of a

central fire, the seat of the presiding Deity, aad of several concentric ·

rings of mingled light and darkness, bounded on the outside by a
wall oi flame. The firstborn oi Gods was Love, by whom tho union
of opposites is brought about. In this we may traco a reminiscence
of the Hesiodic Ἔρως (Ν. D. 1 28).

Zeno of Elea (b. 490 ac.) is chiefly known from his arguments
showing the absurd consequences of the ordinary heliel in the
