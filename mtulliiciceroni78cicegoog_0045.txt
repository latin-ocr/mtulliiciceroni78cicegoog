DE NATURA DEORUM1.

'Ir is now generally recognized that Cicero's philosophical trea-
tises are not to be regarded as original works, but are, as he himself
calls them, ‘adaptations from the Greek' 3 ἀπόγραφα cart, minore ln-
borefinnt,· cerba tentant uffae quibua abundo, Att. xn 52. Hence it
has been the endeavour 01 10101 editors to identify 1110 writers from

books referred to in ἓξ 25-43, probably also that he had 1101 read the
Epicurean books referred 10 in ἓξ 43, 45, 49 ; even if this a priori
conclusion had not been confirmed by the fortunate discovery, among
