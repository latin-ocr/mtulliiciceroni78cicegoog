nonenim sumus—nota. The Stoics held that we could distinguish
true from false sensatione (φαντασίαι, aba) by an infalliblc criterion (σημεῖον,
uota, also translated 0190000 and imipue Ae. 11 34, 36) termed by Chrysip
pus καταληπτικὴ tannetarium comprehensibile, a sensation in which
the soul grasps reality: this is followed by συγκατάθεσιν, amaa, a
declaration 10 ourselves that tho sensation is truc. See Ac. 141,11 17,
18. The Academias denied the existence of such a criterion, hut allowed
that some sensatione were probably true, others the contrary, id 00100 aaa

(Aa. 11 103, and 32-36); the wise man will be guided by what seems
most probable, Aa. 11 99. Carneades distinguished three degees of proba·

ex quo exsistit-regeretur: ‘from which fact (via the close resem-
blance between true and false sensatione) follows the conclusion stated in
the Academica, that there were many things of a probable nature, such
that though not amounting 10 0 full perception, they could newerthelcss,
since they had a marked and distinct appearance, serve to direct the
conduct of a wiso man '. Heind, who is followed by Or. aud Ba, proposed to
omit this sentence as unsuited tothe context, and un-Oiceronian in languege.
The first difficulty 01 construction arises from the change of case in the
relative clause (quae—iet) which may probably be explained by the wish to
substitute the weaker Pass. for the personifying Act (reperetur for repererat).
It may be said, Why not then begin the clause with the Abl quibem instead
of qaae, omitting iis and understanding ea before perciperetur? The
answer is thatin these complex relative clauses, in which the verbs require
different cases, we commonly find the relative attracted 10 the subordi-
nate clause (as quae here to perciperentur for quibus), see Madv. ξ 446,
Zumpt §804‚ where this passage is quoted 'l'he case 01 the second verb

the clause in orat. rect. to be multa suut probabilia, quae...peuipiuatur...
