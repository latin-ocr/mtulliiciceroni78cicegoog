a P.1v 4 qaam emarectationec et amores solati aliteri! so comrecto ire-

queddz esse causam-putaremus Madv. thinks that this clause was

added by a reader who misunderstood the construction miram ri (l) and it
has accordingly been bracketed by later editors The objections as stated
by Sch. Opous. 111317 foll. are (1) that it is superfluous in sense; we hod
already been told that man’s seli-admiration was one of the grounds oi
anthropomorphism; (2) that in reading the sentence,›we naturally take ai as
depending on miram, and it causes an awkward smprise when we find that
it is intended ior the protasis of the sentence; (3) that the sequence oi
tenses is violated by pararemus aiter casa Kl (Adra Oar't. 111 7) defends
the mss reading, andI am inclined to think heis right The clause may
be superfluous in reference to what precedes, but if we look to the follow-
ing ¹sentence, we shall see that it is needed in order to explain the intro-
duction oi ai ratio essct Cicero is secking tc prove that the reason why
man attributes his own form ιο the gods whom he worships, is because
he, in common with other animale, loves his own form best 3 and he pro
cecds ιο argue that this common incident of animal nature would, if acted
upon by reason, lead the other animale each to glorify ( plurimam traba-
raras) his own nature in like manner, cf. the passage from Xenophanes
quoted below. If there is any corruption in the text, one might suggest
the loss of a sentence referring ιο the 3rd reason for anthropomorphism
(dorcadion maara). At present this is passed over without notice, and
Ο. returns ιο the first reason in §d 81-85, only introducing the 3rd in
ξ 87 mixed up there with another argument from experience. As to the
ind objection, there is no doubt a slight awkwardness¹ in separating ri
from miram, but this is certainly not a fatal objection to the correctness oi
the sentence. Or it might be possible tc take εἰ as depending on mirare,
and then to suppose the construction broken, eom esse comam being in·
troduced aa a sort of epexegetic clause, also dependent on miracu Such
a change of construction might be compared with that aiter facit ξ 31
facit Soc. disputantem carsdaosqw albere, after dracmas ξ 75 diod sacra art
...sic rem aaa, after dacae ξ 76. Thirdly the tense ospataremcs is attracted
ιο praemissit, asin Loel. 2 meministi...qacntc acet querela, where the
tense is attracted to an intermediate Imperi, see Draeg. ξ 151 5 c, and
Roby ξ 1517. For the attraction of the pronoun (eom for id) see § 67
and Roby§ 1068.
