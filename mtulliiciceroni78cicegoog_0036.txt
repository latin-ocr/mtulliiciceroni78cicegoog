hera lt will have been noticed that many representatives of the
school were rrot of Greek birth, but only connected with Graece
by the Macedonian conquesta It was easy to rise from this fact
to the higher doctrine which flowed naturally from their first princi-
ple, the doctrine namely that all men were members of one state,
that the world is the common Oity of Gods and men, that all men
are brethren as having the same Divine Father.

Epicureanism may be roughly described as a combination of the
physica of Democritus with the ethica of Aristippus. Epicurus
(all-270 nc.) was an Athenian, born in Samos, where he is said
to have received instruction in the doctrines of Plato and Democritus
(N. D. 1 7 2 dr 93). He founded hia school at Athens about 306 ao,
teaching iu his own ‘Gardem' which became not less famous than the
Stoic ‘Porch'. Among his most distinguished disciples were Metro
dorus (N. D. 1 86, 113) and others mentioned N. D. 1 93. Cicero men·
tions among his own contemporaries Phaedrus, Zeno of Sidon (N. D. 1
59, 93) and Philodemus of Gadara: and his account of the Epicurean
doctrines is probably borrowed from these, especially from the last.
Epicureanism had great success among the Romans ς but, with the
exception of the poet Lucretius, none of the Latin cxpounders cf
the system seem to have been of any importance. Cicero speaks

· with grem contemptos Amafinius and Rabirius (cf. Tusc. 11 7, and

Zeller on the Epicuream, ch. 15).

The end of the Epicurean philosophy was even more exclusively
practical than that of the Stoics. Logic (called by Epicurus ‘Canonic’,
as giving the ‘canon’ or test of truth) and physica, wore merely sub
ordinate to ethics, the art of attaining happiness. Knowledge in
itself is of no value or interest. In fact it has a tendency to corrupt
and distort cur natural judgment and feeling: and thus Epicurus
prided himself on being mainly aelf-taught (N. D. 1 72). Truth is
based on the senses: our sensatione are always to be trusted: error
comes in when we begin to interpret them. Repeated sensatione
produce a permanent image or general notion (πρόληψις, so called
because it exista in the mind as an anticipation of the name which
would be unmeaning if it could not be referred to a known type).
These general notions also are to be trusted as a natural and spon-
taneous growth. But opinions (ὑπολήψεις) about these may be either
true or false3 true, if testified to by the sensatim, or, supposing auch
direct evidence nnattainable, if there is nc contrary sensation; false,
