from Burmann in the following month, Jan. 15 1703, announcing ¹

Graevius' death.

It would be interesting to know whether the collation made by
the adolescens was ever completed, and whether it is still in existence
at Utrecht 01 elsewhere The volume 110011 must have been returned
to its owner, as it was lent by him to Davies 101 his 10101101 the
Tusculana which appeared in 1709, and seems 10 have been used by
the latter until his death in 1732. Αο Bp. Moere’s Library was
purchased by (100. Ι and presented 10 the University 01 Cambridge
in 1715, 100 Stephanus ought to have found its way to the Univer-
sity Library, and 10 00 now safely locked up in one 01 the cases
there, 001 Μ1 Bradshaw‚ the present learned Librarian, informs me
that he can discover no traca 01 11, nor is there anything to 00 heard
01 11 at Quaens’ Collega, 01 which Davies was President.

Ι 1010 now to the Codex Regius which is described as follows in
Davies’ preface to the N. 11,, 000 Illiensea excipit Oodece menrbrana-
ccns in Bibliotheca 110910 1000101 caradas, cujas mibi copiane fecit

100 110 Legibus as belonging to the Royal Library at St James'5

annornm, 01 videtin, cccc. It was also used 101 the Academica Bk. 11
and 101 the 110 Divinatione and De Fato, but apparently not 101 the
Tusculana, where Ileg. stands 101 a Paris Codex. Bentley who suc-
ceeded J ustell aa “Library Keeper 10 His Majesty at St J ames’ '' in
April 1694, wrote in May to Graevius, offering to send him 0011011101
1001101000 ecc dnobus uetustissimis Oodd. ecc Balanea Regia Sancti
Jacobi, but it does not appear whether they were 00010001. As the
King‘s Library was removed in 1752 101110 British Museum, these
two codices ought now to be there, but by a strange satality these
also have disappeared. Is it possible that they were among the 200
volumes ‘destroyed or greatly injured' by the fire atAbingdon House
in 1731, 00 which see Monk's Life of Bentley, 11 308.
