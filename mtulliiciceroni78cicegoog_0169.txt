not have allowed that timo existed even as indefinite duration before
the universe came into being. ‘With the rotation oi the Kosmos began
the course oi time, days, months and years: anterior to the Kosmos
there was no time, no past, present or futura no numerable or measurable
motion or change'. Grote's Plato 111 256. Iu Plato’s own wordsrj μὲν

I ask why was your Pronoea idle in all that vast extent of timel’ But
with the ordinary reading (defended by Sch in his note and also in Opasc.
